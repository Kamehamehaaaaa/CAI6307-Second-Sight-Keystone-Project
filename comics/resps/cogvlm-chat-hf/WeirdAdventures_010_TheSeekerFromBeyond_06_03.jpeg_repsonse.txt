In a vibrant comic book page, a blonde woman in a green outfit with a tiara appears in various settings. She interacts with a man in a white shirt, who seems to be from another time or dimension. In the first panel, she emerges from a pool, greeting him. In the subsequent panels, she is seen in a futuristic setting, surrounded by soldiers and flying objects, discussing a battle with a man in a red uniform. The dialogue suggests a narrative of a past war and a present-day confrontation.
