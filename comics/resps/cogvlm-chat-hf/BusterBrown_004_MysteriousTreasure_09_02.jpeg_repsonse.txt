In this comic book page, we see a tense scene at a hospital where a man named Mooney, the captain of the 'Island Queen', is in a critical condition. Two other men, one of whom is a doctor, are trying to save him. Mooney recounts his adventures, mentioning a pirate named Beau Billows and a treasure of gold pearls. The doctor seems skeptical about the treasure's existence. The setting is a coastal town with a ship docked nearby.
