In this comic book page, a young man with a crown is shown in various adventures. He is quickly cast by a queen's magic spell, making him appear as a horse. He is then ridden by a man, who seems to be in a hurry, and they encounter a woman who is not very pleased with the sudden appearance of the young man as a horse. The young man tries to communicate with her but is interrupted by the man riding him. In the last panel, the young man is shown outside a hut, looking surprised, with a group of people laughing at him.
