In a lush jungle setting, two men, one with a red turban and the other with a green one, are shown interacting with an elephant. The man with the red turban is captivated by the elephant's strength, noting its ability to uproot a tree with its trunk. They decide to capture the elephant, with the man in green suggesting they wait until nighttime. As they set up their camp, the elephant, named Kali, approaches them, and they attempt to tie her up. However, she breaks free, leading to a chase through the jungle. The men eventually capture her, and they plan to send her back to her native land.
