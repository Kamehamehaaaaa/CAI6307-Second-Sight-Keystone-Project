In a vintage comic strip, two men in suits are shown in various panels. In the first panel, one man is being held back by the other, with the latter exclaiming, 'Not so fast, pal! I've got a few questions for you.' In the subsequent panels, the man being held is shown resisting, eventually breaking free and confronting the other man. The narrative suggests a tense exchange between the two, with the man in the suit claiming he's been framed for a crime he didn't commit. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly in an office or a room.
