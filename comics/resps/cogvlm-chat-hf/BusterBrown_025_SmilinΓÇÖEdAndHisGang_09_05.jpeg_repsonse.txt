They are attempting to climb a steep peak, but are faced with challenges. A goat-like creature appears, causing chaos by knocking over the climbers. The man in the red jacket expresses his fear of the creature, while the woman tries to comfort him. They decide to anchor themselves and wait for help. The climbers are in a precarious situation, with the man in the red jacket expressing his inability to climb further.
