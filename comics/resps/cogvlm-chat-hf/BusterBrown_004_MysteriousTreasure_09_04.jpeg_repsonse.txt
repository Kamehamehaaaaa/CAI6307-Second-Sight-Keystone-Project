In this comic book page, we see a group of men on a beach, with one of them expressing concern about a woman's health. They discuss the possibility of her condition being related to a past trauma. Meanwhile, another man, who seems to be in charge, is making a decision about their next move. The setting appears to be a remote location, and the characters are shown interacting with each other, discussing their strategy and concerns.
