In a vibrant comic book page, a woman with a unique headdress and a man in a striped shirt converse in a setting that appears to be a mix of a marketplace and a royal court. The woman, dressed in a colorful outfit, speaks of her father's room and the presence of a peculiar fish that emits a smell. The man, looking surprised, inquires about the nature of the fish and the woman's response reveals a connection to a strange animal that has caused a commotion in the city. The setting is filled with characters, including a man in a yellow outfit and a woman in a red dress, who seem to be engaged in a transaction. The color palette is rich with blues, purples, and yellows, and the art style is reminiscent of mid-20th century comic book illustrations.
