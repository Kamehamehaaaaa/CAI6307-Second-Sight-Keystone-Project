In a vibrant comic strip, a group of characters prepares for a snowy mountain vacation. They discuss their plans, with one character expressing excitement about skiing. The setting is a snowy village with a bus labeled 'Mountain' and a character named 'Skipper' who seems to be in charge of the trip. The characters are dressed in winter attire, and there's a playful interaction between them, with one character humorously suggesting they climb a mountain early in the morning.
