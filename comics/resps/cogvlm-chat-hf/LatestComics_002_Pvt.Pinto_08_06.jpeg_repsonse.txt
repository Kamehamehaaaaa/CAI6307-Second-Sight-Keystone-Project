In this vintage comic book page, a character named Lulu is seen interacting with a large machine. She is initially curious about the machine, asking if it's a 'real thing' and expressing her desire to see its operation. As she approaches the machine, she notices a break in the system and warns the operator. Later, she is seen observing a panel with various buttons and switches, commenting on the complexity of the machine. In another scene, she is seen running away from a man who seems to be in a hurry, possibly to warn someone or escape from a situation.
