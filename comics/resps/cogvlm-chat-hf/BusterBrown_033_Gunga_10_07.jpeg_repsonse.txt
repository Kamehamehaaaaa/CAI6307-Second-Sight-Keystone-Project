In a vibrant jungle setting, two men, one in green and the other in red, are shown observing a massive elephant. They discuss the dangers of hunting such a creature, with one man expressing his reluctance to take a shot. The elephant, named Gunga, is described as being both powerful and intelligent. The men notice a younger elephant, referred to as a 'bull', and one of them comments on its robust appearance. The comic is from 'Tales of the Jungle' and is credited to 'King Features Syndicate'.
