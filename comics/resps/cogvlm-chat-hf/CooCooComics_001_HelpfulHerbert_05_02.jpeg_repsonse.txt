On a sunny beach, a large, round, orange creature floats in the sky, causing surprise among the beachgoers. A man, wanting to buy the creature's water, approaches it, but the creature's sudden release of water creates a massive splash. The man, now wet, tries to buy the creature's water, but the creature's owner, a woman in a red swimsuit, refuses, saying some people can't afford it. The man, looking dejected, walks away, leaving the beachgoers in amusement.
