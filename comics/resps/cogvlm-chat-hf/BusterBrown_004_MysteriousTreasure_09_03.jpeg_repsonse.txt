In a vibrant comic book page, a group of men on a ship navigate turbulent waters. They are on a mission to find a lost city, with one of the men, Captain James, taking the helm. As they approach a cove, they spot a canoe with two men. The captain, curious about their intentions, asks if they are there for supplies. One of the men, named Taboo, responds that they are there for men, hinting at a potential conflict or challenge ahead.
