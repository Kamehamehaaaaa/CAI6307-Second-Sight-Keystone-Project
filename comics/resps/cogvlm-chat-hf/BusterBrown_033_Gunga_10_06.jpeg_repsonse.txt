In a lush jungle setting, three men, dressed in simple clothing, interact with an elephant named Rama. One of the men, wearing a red turban, is concerned about the weight of a heavy object they've placed on the elephant's back. Another man, in green, suggests they should move the object to prevent the elephant from feeling burdened. The third man, in orange, is curious about the elephant's behavior and wonders if it's possible to make the elephant stop from moving. The man in green emphasizes the importance of understanding the elephant's nature and behavior.
