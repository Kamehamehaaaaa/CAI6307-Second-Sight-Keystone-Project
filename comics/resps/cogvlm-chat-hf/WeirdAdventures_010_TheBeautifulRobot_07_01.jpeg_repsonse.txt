In a vibrant comic book page, a man in a tuxedo kneels on one knee, holding a ring box, asking a woman in a purple gown to marry him. The setting appears to be an outdoor garden with a large moon in the background. The woman, named Agatha, is seated on a lounge chair, and the man, named John, is eagerly awaiting her response. The dialogue suggests that John has been infatuated with Agatha for a long time and is now formally proposing. Agatha, however, is hesitant, expressing uncertainty about her feelings for John and questioning why he would want to marry her.
