In a vintage comic strip, a man and a woman sit on a park bench under a moonlit sky. The woman, dressed in a red dress, tells the man about a mysterious event that happened to her, hinting at something supernatural. The man, dressed in a suit, is surprised and concerned. As the story unfolds, the woman reveals that she was abducted by aliens and that she's pregnant. The man expresses shock and concern, and the woman assures him that she's okay. The comic ends with the man promising to do anything to help her.
