In a vintage comic book, a ship named 'The Mysterious Island Ship' is shown approaching a smaller boat. The larger ship is manned by three men, two of whom are holding guns, while the third is in the captain's chair. The smaller boat has a man named Kala and a child. As the larger ship gets closer, the captain of the smaller boat warns them to lower their sails. However, the captain of the larger ship, named Charles, refuses, claiming he's on a secret mission. The smaller boat's captain then decides to post a man named Ashore when he becomes too much of a threat. The interaction is intense, with the smaller boat's captain showing determination and the larger ship's captain being defiant.
