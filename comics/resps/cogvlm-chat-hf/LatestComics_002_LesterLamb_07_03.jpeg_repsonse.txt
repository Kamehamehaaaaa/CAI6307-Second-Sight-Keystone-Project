In this comic page, a white goat-like character is shown in various panels. In the first panel, it is startled by a bell, causing it to knock over a machine. In the second panel, it is seen trying to extinguish a fire with water, but a human character tries to stop it. The goat then runs away, causing a young girl to drop her ice cream cone. The goat later returns, looking remorseful, and the human character seems to forgive it.
