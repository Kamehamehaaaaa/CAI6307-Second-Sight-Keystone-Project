This is a vintage comic book page featuring a group of men, one of whom is a doctor, discussing a mysterious swirling river. They are in a cabin, with one of the men pointing out the river's location on a map. The doctor mentions a previous encounter with a similar phenomenon, and they all speculate on its cause. The setting is outdoors, with a focus on the river and the surrounding landscape.
