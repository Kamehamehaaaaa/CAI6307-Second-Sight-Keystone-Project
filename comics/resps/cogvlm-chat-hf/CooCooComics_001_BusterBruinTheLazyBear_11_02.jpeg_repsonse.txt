In a vintage comic strip, a bear wakes up with a startled expression, exclaiming that nothing feels right after a few months. He hears a dripping sound and jumps up, exclaiming 'Drip! Splat!'. He decides to fix the leak, and in a dramatic turn of events, he exclaims 'WOW!' as he realizes the extent of the damage.
