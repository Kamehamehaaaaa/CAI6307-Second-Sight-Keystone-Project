In this comic book page, we see a character resembling a rabbit in various panels. In the first panel, he seems to be in motion with a 'ZIP' sound effect, and in the second, he's shown with a surprised expression. In the third panel, he's surrounded by other characters, and one of them is shouting 'VOTE! GOODNESS! MAMA! THESE GOODIES ARE GONNA LICK!'. The rabbit character looks alarmed and says 'Oh! They are here!'. In the next panel, there's a sound effect 'OOF! OOW!', and the rabbit character seems to be in a struggle. In the last panel, he's seen with a surprised expression, and there's a question mark above his head.
