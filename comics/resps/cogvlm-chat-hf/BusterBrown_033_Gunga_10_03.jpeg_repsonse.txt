In a vibrant jungle setting, a man in red shorts and sandals, named Baba, is shown interacting with an elephant named Radar. In the first panel, Baba is seen running away from an angry elephant, exclaiming 'BACK, RADAR, BACK!'. In the subsequent panels, Baba is seen trying to calm down the elephant by offering it some food, but the elephant becomes aggressive and crushes a hut. Baba then retreats to the jungle, leaving Radar behind.
