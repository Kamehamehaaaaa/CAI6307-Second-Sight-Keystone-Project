In a vibrant comic book page, two characters, Jinn and Marah, are shown in a mystical setting. Jinn, a man with a stern expression, is commanding Marah to go to the window and find the 'Lavender Lake'. Marah, a woman with a surprised expression, is seen flying on a large bird, with Jinn riding on her back. They are looking for a green bird and a white bird, which are said to be in a clearing near the lake. The setting is filled with colorful landscapes, including mountains, trees, and a body of water. The textual content provides a narrative of their mission and the significance of the birds they are looking for.
