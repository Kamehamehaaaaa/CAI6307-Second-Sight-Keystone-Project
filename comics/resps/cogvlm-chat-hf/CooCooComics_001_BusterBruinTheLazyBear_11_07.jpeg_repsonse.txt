In a vibrant comic strip, two anthropomorphic bears, one in blue and the other in orange, embark on a fun-filled adventure. They playfully slide down a snowy mountain, with the orange bear exclaiming 'Eagles' Eggs!' as they reach the bottom. The blue bear, looking concerned, asks 'Goodness-- Where are the kids?'. The orange bear, appearing a bit flustered, replies 'Huh?'. The scene then shifts to the blue bear, looking worried, whispering 'Yoo-hoo! Jasper! Wilbur!'. The orange bear, realizing the implication, hurriedly runs off, saying 'Omigosh... I bet they're climbing that tree!'. The setting is a snowy mountain landscape with trees and a clear blue sky.
