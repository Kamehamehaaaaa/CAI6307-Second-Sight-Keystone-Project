In this comic book page, two men, one in a red suit and the other in a blue suit, are shown in a room with a lamp, a table, and a painting. The man in the red suit is in distress, talking about a tragic accident involving his wife and daughter. He is seeking help from the man in the blue suit, who is initially hesitant but eventually agrees to assist him. The man in the blue suit reflects on his own life and the choices he has made, which might have led to his current state of solitude.
