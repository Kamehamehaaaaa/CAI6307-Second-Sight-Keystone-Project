In this vintage comic strip, a young boy named Pal is taken to a doctor's office by his father. The doctor, wearing a green suit, inquires about Pal's health, noting his lack of patience and his tendency to fall. The boy, wearing a striped shirt, responds with a mix of defiance and concern. The doctor suggests that Pal might have a hearing problem, and the boy expresses his frustration with his voice. The setting appears to be a simple room with a window, and the interaction is characterized by dialogue and body language, capturing a moment of medical consultation and personal revelation.
