In this vintage comic strip, a man and a boy are excitedly discussing their plan to start a bee farm. They gather bees and place them in a hive, with the boy expressing his joy at the prospect of making money from the honey. The bees are depicted as busy workers, and the boy is shown flying around with a bee suit. The comic humorously touches on the idea of the bees' potential value, with signs indicating different prices for the honey. The final panel humorously suggests that the bees might be considered 'heavenly' due to their productive nature.
