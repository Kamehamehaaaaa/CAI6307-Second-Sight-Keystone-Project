In this comic page, a bear character is shown waking up from a nap, feeling the warmth of spring. He excitedly gets ready to go outside, but is interrupted by the alarm clock ringing. He seems to be in a hurry to get some sun, but ends up getting wet in the rain. The bear looks frustrated as he tries to dry himself, with the final panel showing him sitting in a chair, looking disheartened.
