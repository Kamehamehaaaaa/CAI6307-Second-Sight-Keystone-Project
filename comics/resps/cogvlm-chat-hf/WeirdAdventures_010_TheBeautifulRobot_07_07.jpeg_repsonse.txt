In a vintage comic book, a woman in a red dress is startled by a sudden crash, with a man in a suit holding her. She questions the source of the noise, and the man, looking distressed, mentions a 'beautiful robot'. The woman is skeptical, asking why there's nothing left of the robot, to which the man replies that it was made of metal. The woman then comments on the robot's creation, suggesting it was a 'piece of work'. The comic is titled 'The Metal Monster' and is credited to 'Jack Williamson'.
