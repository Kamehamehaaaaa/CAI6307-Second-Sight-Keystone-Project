Buster Bruin, the lazy bear, is shown in a comic strip. He's in bed, stretching and yawning, indicating he's about to start hibernating for the winter. He's wearing a nightcap and pajamas. On the table next to him are various items, including a bottle labeled 'Winter's Frost' and another labeled 'Spring's Blossom'. He's looking at an alarm clock with the words 'Spring' and 'Summer' on it, and he's saying, 'I'll set it for spring.' The comic is from the 1940s, as indicated by the copyright date at the bottom.
