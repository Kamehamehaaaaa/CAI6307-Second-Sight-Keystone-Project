In this comic strip, there are animated bees who are discussing the task of making honey. They are flying around and talking about the process, with one bee expressing frustration about the sticky honey. They also discuss the need for a special container to store the honey. In the end, they decide to condense the honey into a mattress-like shape and place it in a container.
