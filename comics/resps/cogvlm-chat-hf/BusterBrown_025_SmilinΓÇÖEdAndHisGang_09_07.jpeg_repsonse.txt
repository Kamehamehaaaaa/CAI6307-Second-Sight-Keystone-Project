In this comic page, we see a man named Salty, who is a traveler, trying to ice skate. He falls and is helped by a frog character named Slim. They converse about Salty's clumsiness and the danger of the ice. Slim warns Salty about the thin ice and advises him to be careful. In the end, Salty humorously exclaims 'HALP!' as he falls into the water.
