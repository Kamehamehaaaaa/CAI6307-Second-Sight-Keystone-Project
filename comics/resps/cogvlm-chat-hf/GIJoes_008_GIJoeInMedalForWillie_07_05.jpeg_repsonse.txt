In a vibrant comic strip, a soldier in blue and another in green helmets are shown in a war setting. The blue-helmeted soldier is in the foreground, narrating an intense moment where he and his team are under fire. They are trying to get artillery support, and the green-helmeted soldier is communicating with the artillery battery. The comic captures the urgency and tension of warfare, with explosions, gunfire, and the soldiers' reactions to the situation.
