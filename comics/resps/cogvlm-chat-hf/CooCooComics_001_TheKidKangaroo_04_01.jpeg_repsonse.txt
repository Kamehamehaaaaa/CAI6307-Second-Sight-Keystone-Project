in a vibrant forest setting, a yellow kangaroo with a checkered pattern is seen lounging on a tree trunk, while a smaller rabbit character approaches him with a speech bubble saying 'ah! alone at last! some adventure...'. the kangaroo, seemingly relaxed, responds with 'huh? dunno why. guess i'll hop around and see what's cookin'. further down, the rabbit character is seen running away in panic, with a speech bubble saying 'hurts darned if i do!'. a lion, looking surprised, exclaims 'him...'. the comic is titled 'the kid kangaroo' and is from the 'daily comic strip' series.
