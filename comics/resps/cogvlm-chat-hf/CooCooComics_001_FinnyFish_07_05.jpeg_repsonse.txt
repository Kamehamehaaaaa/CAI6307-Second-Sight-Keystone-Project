In this comic book page, we see a group of animated characters, including a blue creature, a yellow bird, and a green dinosaur, interacting in a desert-like setting. The blue creature, named Johnny, is trying to escape from the green dinosaur named Swampy. The yellow bird, named Pinky, is also present and seems to be assisting Johnny. The dinosaur is trying to catch the characters, and there's a humorous interaction where the dinosaur is reminded of a previous incident where he tried to eat the characters. The comic is filled with dialogue, action, and a sense of adventure.
