In this comic book page, we see a group of dwarves in a forest setting, with one of them, Snow White, being chased by a creature. The dwarves are in a state of panic, calling out for Prince Charming. They believe he is the only one who can save them. The dwarf with the long beard, presumably Grumpy, is trying to calm them down and inform them that Prince Charming is not the real hero. Instead, it's a prince who has been turned into a rat by a witch. The dwarves are in disbelief and shock, with one of them exclaiming 'Shut up!'. The scene ends with the dwarves discovering a rat-like prince in a barrel, and one of them exclaiming 'Supper ready!'.
