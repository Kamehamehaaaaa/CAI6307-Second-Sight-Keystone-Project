In this comic page, a man is excitedly preparing for a skiing event, but he's struggling to get into his ski suit. A frog character, wearing a ski outfit, offers to help him. The man is initially hesitant but eventually agrees. The frog character then humorously suggests that the man should try skiing without the suit, and the man, realizing the frog's point, decides to take off his outfit. The setting appears to be a snowy mountain, and there are other characters, including a mouse, watching the interaction.
