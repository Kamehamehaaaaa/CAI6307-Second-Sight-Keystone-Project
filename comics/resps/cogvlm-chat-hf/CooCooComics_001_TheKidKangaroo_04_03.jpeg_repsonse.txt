In a vibrant comic strip, a small rabbit character finds itself in a perilous situation, swimming in water with a lion nearby. The rabbit, displaying a sense of bravery, attempts to punch the lion, leading to a series of comedic reactions. The lion, initially surprised, then playfully chases the rabbit, who, in a final act of defiance, shouts 'MAMA!' as it escapes.
