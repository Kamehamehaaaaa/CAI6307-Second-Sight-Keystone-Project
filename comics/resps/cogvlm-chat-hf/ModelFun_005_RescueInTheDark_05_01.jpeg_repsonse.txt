In this vintage comic book page, we see a group of cowboys in a rustic setting. The main character, Bob, is excitedly showing a new invention, a spinning wheel, to another cowboy named Joe. Joe is skeptical, questioning the practicality of the invention. The setting is a wooden cabin with a horse outside, and the dialogue is filled with cowboy lingo, such as 'You would?' and 'No adventure? Look, first comes the time & model...'. The comic is titled 'Rescue in the Dark' and is published by Hale Comics, with a copyright date of 1950.
