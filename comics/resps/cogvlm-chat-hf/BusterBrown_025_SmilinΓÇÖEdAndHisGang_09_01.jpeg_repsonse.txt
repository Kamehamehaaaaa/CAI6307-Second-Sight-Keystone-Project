smilin' ed and his gang visit sun valley. they are in a cozy room with a fireplace. smilin' ed is talking to a man in a suit, and there's a frog and a cat nearby. smilin' ed is asking the man if he can have a mountain climbing spot, and the man is agreeing. there's also a small note at the bottom about smilin' ed and his friends going on a vacation.
