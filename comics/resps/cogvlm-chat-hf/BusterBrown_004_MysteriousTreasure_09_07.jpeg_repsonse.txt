In this vintage comic book page, a young man named Jack is shown swimming in the ocean, with a group of men on a boat in the background. The men on the boat are discussing the location of a treasure, with one of them pointing out Jack's location. They seem to be in a tropical setting, with palm trees and other vegetation visible. The interaction between the characters is tense, with one man threatening Jack and another trying to reason with him. The textual content includes dialogues like 'Mannah, on the swift!' and 'You're wastin' time in your trash, Jack!'
