In a vibrant comic book page, two men stand on a dock, with one of them, wearing a yellow shirt and blue pants, looking sternly at the other, who is shirtless and in green pants. The background showcases a ship and a large moon. The man in the yellow shirt mentions a 'mysterious treasure' and recounts an incident where he and his companion, referred to as 'Kala', faced a dangerous sea hawk. The narrative continues with the man in the yellow shirt warning the other about a man named 'Mike' who might attack them.
