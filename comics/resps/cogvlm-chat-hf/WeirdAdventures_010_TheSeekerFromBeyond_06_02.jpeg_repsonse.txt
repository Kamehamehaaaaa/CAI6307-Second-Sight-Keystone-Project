In this vintage comic book page, a man is shown in a state of panic as he watches a woman in a green outfit and headdress, who appears to have superhuman abilities, save people from a fiery car accident. The man is desperate to get her attention and help her, but she seems preoccupied with her task. The setting is an urban street with onlookers, and the color palette is rich with bold reds, blues, and yellows, capturing the intensity of the scene.
