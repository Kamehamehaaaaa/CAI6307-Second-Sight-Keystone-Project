In a vibrant comic book page, a young man in blue attire, accompanied by a woman in a pink dress, encounters a massive purple creature in a desert setting. The creature, named Jinn, is being summoned by a man in a red turban. The man in the turban has a plan to transform the Jinn into an eagle, and the young man is skeptical. The woman suggests they have another plan in case the transformation doesn't work. The background showcases a vast desert landscape with rocky formations and a setting sun.
