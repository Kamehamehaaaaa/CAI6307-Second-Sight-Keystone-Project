In a vintage comic book, there's a story of two bears, one brown and one blue, in a bedroom setting. The brown bear is trying to get the blue bear to sleep by telling a bedtime story. The story begins with the brown bear saying 'Wah! Eeyow!' and the blue bear responding with 'Go to sleep!'. The brown bear then begins the tale, mentioning 'Once upon a time there were three bears...'. The blue bear seems to be getting more and more restless as the story progresses, eventually falling asleep with the words '...and the little bear said: 333333333'. The brown bear concludes the story with 'Pst!'.
