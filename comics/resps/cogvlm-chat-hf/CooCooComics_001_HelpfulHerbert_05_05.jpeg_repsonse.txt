In a vibrant beach setting, a muscular man in black shorts confronts a man in a suit and tie, accusing him of stealing his tire. The man in the suit, looking panicked, admits to borrowing the tire to tell his wife a story. The muscular man, angered, threatens to throw him into the ocean. However, before he can, the man in the suit reveals a small airplane, suggesting he used the tire to build it. The muscular man, in awe, decides to let him go and even offers to help him save his own plane.
