In this vintage comic strip, a soldier is shown in a series of panels where he is aggressively interacting with a woman. In the first panel, he is punching her, and in the subsequent panels, he is trying to force her to reveal something. The woman, in turn, is trying to fend him off and question his actions. The soldier's dialogue includes phrases like 'Never hit a woman in the circumstances...', 'Bull's eye! Now to see the score!', and 'Rah! My saboteur! You're not going to get away with this!'. The setting appears to be outdoors, possibly in a park or a field.
