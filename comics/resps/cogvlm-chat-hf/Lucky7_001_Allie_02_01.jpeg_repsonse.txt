In a vintage comic strip, a young boy named Alvin is shown interacting with a man named Papa. Alvin brings a letter from his school teacher, claiming she's wrong about something. Papa, in a playful manner, tests Alvin's knowledge by asking him to throw a spitball. When Alvin misses, Papa humorously suggests that his mouth is full of germs. The interaction ends with Papa giving Alvin a stern warning and Alvin promising not to throw spitballs again.
