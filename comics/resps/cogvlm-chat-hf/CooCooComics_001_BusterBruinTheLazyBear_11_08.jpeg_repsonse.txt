In a snowy mountain setting, a bear in an orange robe is seen attempting to climb a steep cliff. The bear expresses hope that the climb will be successful, saying 'I hope this w-works!'. As the bear struggles to climb, it uses a stick to help itself, thinking 'I hope this w-works!'. The bear seems to be making progress, thinking 'Hmmm! Tresspasser!'. However, in the next panel, the bear falls off the cliff, exclaiming 'Whew!'. Just as the bear is about to hit the ground, a goat appears, causing the bear to exclaim 'Eee-Yow!'. The goat then kicks the bear, causing the bear to shout 'WHUMP!'. The goat's action is labeled 'Garrr-rish!'. The comic strip is credited to 'Walt Disney'.
