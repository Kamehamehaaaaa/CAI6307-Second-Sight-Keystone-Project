In this vintage comic book page, a man reads a newspaper titled 'Bright City News' while a city is under attack. He calls the police, expressing concern about the safety of his wife and daughter. The police chief assures him that everything is under control, but the situation quickly escalates as the city is bombarded. The page is filled with dramatic visuals of explosions, military vehicles, and panicked civilians.
