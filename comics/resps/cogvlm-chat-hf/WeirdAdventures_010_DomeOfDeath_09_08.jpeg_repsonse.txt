In this vintage comic book page, two men are shown in a room with one of them holding a gun, while the other appears to be in distress. The man with the gun is trying to convince the other to go to a location called 'Arrow's Point' to retrieve something. The distressed man is hesitant, but eventually agrees. As they leave, the man with the gun warns the other about a woman named 'Damella' who might be a danger. The scene transitions to an outdoor setting where the two men are chased by a woman, who turns out to be the one they were trying to retrieve. The man with the gun is caught off guard and falls, while the other man manages to escape.
