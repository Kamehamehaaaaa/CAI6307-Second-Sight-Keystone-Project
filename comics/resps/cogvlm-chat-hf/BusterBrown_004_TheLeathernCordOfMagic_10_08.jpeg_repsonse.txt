In a vibrant comic book page, a man is seen in a bed, surrounded by two women with distinctive headdresses. One woman, with a green headdress, is pouring a liquid from a bottle into a glass. The man in the bed is in a conversation with the woman with the green headdress, expressing his desire to be free from the spell that keeps him in bed. The woman with the green headdress advises him to be patient and not to fear, as the magic is still held by the old man in the background. The setting appears to be a room with a window, and the color palette is rich with purples, blues, and yellows.
