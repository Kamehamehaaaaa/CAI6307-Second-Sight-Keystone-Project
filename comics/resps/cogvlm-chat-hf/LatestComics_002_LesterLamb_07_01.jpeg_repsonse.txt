Mary had a little lamb, as cute as can be, but today it's causing quite a scene. She's outside the butcher shop, looking quite perplexed, with the lamb running wild, causing quite a commotion. The shop's window displays 'Lamb Chops' for sale, and the lamb seems to be trying to get inside. Mary's dialogue with the lamb is filled with surprise and confusion, as she tries to understand why the lamb is behaving this way.
