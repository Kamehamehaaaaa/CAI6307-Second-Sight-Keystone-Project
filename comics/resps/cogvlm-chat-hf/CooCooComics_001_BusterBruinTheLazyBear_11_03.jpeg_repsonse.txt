In a snowy setting, a bear in an orange outfit is shown in various panels. In the first panel, the bear is seen sliding down a snowy slope, exclaiming 'Aha! So that's it!'. In the second panel, the bear is shown hitting a rock with a hammer, producing a 'WHAM!' sound. The third panel depicts the bear's shocked expression as it hits the rock again, producing a 'BANG!' sound. The bear then realizes it needs to sleep for spring, as indicated by the text 'That does it now to sleep for spring!'. In the fourth panel, the bear is seen hitting a rock with a chopstick, producing a 'CHOP CHOP CHOP' sound. The bear then lies down, seemingly satisfied, with the text 'Now what...'.
