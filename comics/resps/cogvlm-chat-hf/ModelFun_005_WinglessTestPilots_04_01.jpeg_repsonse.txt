This comic book page is from a vintage comic book, showcasing a dramatic scene where a wingless aircraft crashes into a body of water. The title of the page reads 'WINGLESS TEST-PILOTS!' and there are three panels. In the first panel, two men are seen running away from the crashing plane, with one of them exclaiming, 'Hurry before the plane crashes! We don't want to look too guilty!' In the second panel, one of the men is seen holding a model of the aircraft, saying, 'Sure, it could have been a lot worse. It's just a model!' In the third panel, the crashed plane is submerged in water, and the text reads, 'Something's gone wrong, it's crashing!'
