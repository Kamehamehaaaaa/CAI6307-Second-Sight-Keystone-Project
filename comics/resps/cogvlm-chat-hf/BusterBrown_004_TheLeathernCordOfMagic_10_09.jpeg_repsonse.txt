In a vibrant comic book page, a man in a turban and robe stands in a room with a woman in a yellow dress and a headdress. He speaks of a mystical blade and its power, and how he has to protect it. He warns of a sorcerer named Balkan who seeks the blade's power. The man prepares to face this sorcerer, and the woman looks on with concern. The man recalls a prophecy that he will be lost if he doesn't protect the blade.
