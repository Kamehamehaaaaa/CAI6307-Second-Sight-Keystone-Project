The comic book page is titled 'The Man Who Lived Backwards!' It features a man with sweat on his face, looking distressed, with a woman with red hair and a man in a suit holding a drink. The man in the suit is speaking to the distressed man, offering him a chance to meet a girl. The background shows a laboratory setting with a man working on a machine. The text on the page includes dialogues between the characters, such as 'My soul was steeped in horror... unglutted horror!' and 'I little dreamed of what lay ahead of me.'
