In this vibrant comic page, a lion magician named Leo is performing a trick where he makes a girl disappear. As he waves his wand, the audience, including a fox and a rabbit, watches in anticipation. However, the trick doesn't go as planned, and the girl reappears, causing a comedic surprise. Leo, looking flustered, tries to recover by making the girl disappear again, but this time, he accidentally makes a rabbit disappear instead. The fox, noticing the chaos, advises Leo to keep the girl warm, and the page ends with Leo looking distressed and the rabbit floating in the air.
