In a vibrant comic book page, a man in a green outfit with a red turban and a young girl in a yellow dress are shown in a dramatic setting. The man, who seems to be in a state of distress, is surrounded by a cloud of green smoke with ghostly figures. He calls upon the 'Good Romans' and the 'Good Will' to help him. In another part of the page, the same man is shown in a confrontation with a man in a green outfit, who is casting a spell. The man in green is trying to harm the girl, but the man in the red turban is protecting her. The man in the red turban is also shown praying to Allah for protection for his children.
