In this comic book page, there's a lion magician performing a trick where he makes a girl vanish. He starts by saying he can't perform the trick because he's allergic to girls. However, he decides to try anyway. He pulls a girl out of a box and then makes her disappear, leaving only her silhouette. The audience is left in shock and amazement. The lion magician then comments on how wonderful and terrifying the trick was.
