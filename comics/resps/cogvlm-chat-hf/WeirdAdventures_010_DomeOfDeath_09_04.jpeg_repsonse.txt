In this vintage comic strip, a woman in a red dress is distressed, holding a man's face, as they discuss a machine that can't be stopped. They are in a room with a shadowy figure in the background. The man, wearing a suit, assures her that the machine is working perfectly. Outside, a train is shown with a man standing on the tracks, and a truck is shown crashing into a car on the highway. The woman expresses her fear and concern, and the man tries to reassure her.
