In this comic book page, we see a group of anthropomorphic animals, including a mouse, a frog, and a bee, engaging in winter activities. They are on a frozen lake, attempting to rescue a fellow animal who has fallen into the icy water. The mouse, who seems to be the leader, is trying to keep the spirits high and is encouraging the others to keep going. They use a long pole to reach the animal, and the frog is shown to be quite the hero, swimming under the ice to rescue the fallen animal. The bee is also involved, suggesting they should keep going until they reach the other side of the lake. Throughout the page, there are humorous interactions and dialogues, showcasing the camaraderie and determination of the group.
