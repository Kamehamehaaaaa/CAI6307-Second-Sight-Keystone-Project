In a vintage comic strip, a man in a green suit is shown in various panels. In the first panel, he is seen falling, with a man in a blue suit and hat rushing to his aid. The man in the green suit is later seen lying on the ground, with another man, wearing a hat and suit, questioning him about a mysterious object he had with him. The green-suited man mentions a 'little old man' who gave him the object. In another scene, the man in the green suit is at a police station, where he is questioned about the object and its significance. He also mentions a 'Mr. Mudra' and a 'Mr. Hood'. The comic strip is filled with dialogues, and the art style is reminiscent of mid-20th century comic books.
