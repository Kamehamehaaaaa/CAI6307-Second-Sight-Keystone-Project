On this comic book page, there's a young boy named Willie who is having a playful time with another boy. They're in an outdoor setting with a house in the background. Willie is wearing a yellow shirt and blue cap, while the other boy is dressed in a red shirt and black pants. They're playing with a frisbee, and in the third panel, the older boy tells Willie that he's forgotten the name of the game. Willie seems surprised and says he knows he hasn't forgotten. The older boy then points out that Willie hasn't learned the name of the game yet.
