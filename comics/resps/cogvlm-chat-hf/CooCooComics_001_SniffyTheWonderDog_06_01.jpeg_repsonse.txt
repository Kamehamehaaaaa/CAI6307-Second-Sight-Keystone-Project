In this vintage comic book page, we see a character named Sniffy the Wonder Dog in a store called Pooch Palace. Sniffy is eager to be adopted and is shown interacting with a storekeeper. The storekeeper is initially hesitant but eventually agrees to let Sniffy stay for a week. The interaction is filled with dialogue, such as 'Come on, look at a real live dog!' and 'I never expected to be selling a dog in a week!'. The art style is colorful and cartoonish, typical of mid-20th century comic books.
