In this vintage comic book page, a man named Al is in a phone booth, seemingly in distress, calling a bank to find out about a large sum of money. The banker, Mr. Moulsecoomb, is depicted as a stern figure, and the interaction between them is tense. Al is trying to find out if the money is still available, and the banker is reluctant to provide information. The setting is a bank, and the interaction is primarily through phone calls. The comic uses a mix of dialogue and visuals to convey the story, with the characters' expressions and body language playing a significant role in conveying their emotions and intentions.
