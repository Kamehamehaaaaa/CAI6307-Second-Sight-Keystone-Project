In a vibrant jungle setting, a young rabbit named Bugs Bunny is seen interacting with a lion. Bugs, confidently climbing a tree, is unaware of the lion's intentions. The lion, appearing frustrated, exclaims his inability to climb trees. Bugs, feeling safe, responds with a cheeky 'Safe last!'. As Bugs continues to climb, the lion, in a desperate attempt, tries to climb the tree as well. The comic ends with the lion's failed attempt, and Bugs, looking down with a smirk, comments on the lion's inability to climb trees.
