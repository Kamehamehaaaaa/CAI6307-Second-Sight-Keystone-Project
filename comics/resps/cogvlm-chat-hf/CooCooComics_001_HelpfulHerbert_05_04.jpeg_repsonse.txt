In a vintage comic strip, a man in a suit and hat is seen at a beach, attempting to throw a lifebuoy to a woman in a swimsuit. He misses, and the woman thanks him. However, a muscular man in the background, noticing the man's inability to throw the lifebuoy, offers to do it for him. The muscular man is praised as a 'real hero' by the woman. In the final panel, the muscular man is shown with a shocked expression, and the man in the suit is shown with a smug look, having presumably used the muscular man's praise to his advantage.
