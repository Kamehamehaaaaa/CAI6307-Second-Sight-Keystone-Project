In this comic strip, a man is seen walking along a beach, looking forlorn. He comes across a sign offering free parking and walking, but there's a catch - you have to save tires to avail of it. As he approaches the sign, he realizes the irony and humor in the situation, as the sign is placed right next to a car that's run out of tires. The man seems to be in a dilemma, wondering if he should help the car owner or continue on his walk.
