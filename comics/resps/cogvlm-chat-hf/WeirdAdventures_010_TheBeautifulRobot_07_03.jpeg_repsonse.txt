In this vintage comic book page, a woman lounges on a couch, expressing her desire to be kissed by a man she's never met. The man, intrigued by her boldness, approaches her. They share a passionate kiss, and the woman reveals her name as 'Katha'. The man, named John, is a scientist who has invented a robot that can mimic human emotions. Katha is curious about this invention and asks John to demonstrate the robot's ability to kiss. John complies, and the robot, named 'The Beautiful Robot', successfully imitates Katha's kiss. The interaction between the characters is interspersed with dialogue that highlights their feelings and reactions to the situation.
