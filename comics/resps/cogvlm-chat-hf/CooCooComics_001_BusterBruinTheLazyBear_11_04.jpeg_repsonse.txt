In a snowy forest, a bear and two beavers are building a dam. The bear is excited about the progress, but the beavers are trying to keep quiet. The bear falls into the snow, and the beavers laugh at his misfortune. The bear, feeling embarrassed, goes to bed, thinking he'll get some sleep. However, he is disturbed by the sound of the dam collapsing.
