finny fish is a green fish with a red bowtie and hat, standing in a blue sky with clouds and bubbles. he is wearing a black suit and is holding out his hand, looking surprised. there is a house in the background with a pink roof and a tree. below, there are two fish characters, one with a mustache and the other without, standing in a yard with a fence and a tree. the mustached fish is holding a sign that says 'sale!' and the other fish is saying 'owwowow!' as he lifts a dumbbell. the text on the page says 'finny fish', 'my, oh my! finny fish! i can't believe it! myself to the rescue!', 'there came a day when finny fish was a slow, plump, rubber-bombast fish!', 'finny fish was a 1000 pound fish!', and 'owwowowow!'.
