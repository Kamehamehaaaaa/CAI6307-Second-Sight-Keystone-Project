In a vividly colored comic book page, a man named Swifty Shannon is portrayed as a hero who has the ability to fly and control the weather. He is shown in a cityscape, with planes flying around and explosions occurring. Swifty is described as having saved thousands of lives by preventing a disaster. In the comic, he is shown interacting with a family, where he is asked to fly to their house, and he responds with a casual 'Ring!'. The text on the page also mentions the Brown Building as the tallest in the city and a significant landmark.
