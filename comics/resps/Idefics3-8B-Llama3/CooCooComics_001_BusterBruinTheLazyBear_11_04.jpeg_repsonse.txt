The comic book page shows a group of animals standing in the snow. One of the animals, who is wearing a red shirt, is saying "That's tellin' 'em - now mebbe some sleep?". Another animal, who is brown, is saying "We gotta chop down this tree - we're building a dam!". In the bottom left corner, there is a brown animal sleeping in a bed. The word "TIMBER!" is written in red letters.
