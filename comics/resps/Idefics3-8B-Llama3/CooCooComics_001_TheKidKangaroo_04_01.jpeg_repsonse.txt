The comic book page is titled "The Kid Kangaroo" and features a scene with several characters. In the first panel, a brown kangaroo is talking to a small, yellow, checkered snake. The snake is saying, "Mom's asleep, guess I'll slip out and see what's cooking!" The kangaroo responds with a surprised expression and the text "Huh? Did I say alone?" In the second panel, the kangaroo is seen running away from the snake, with the text "Ah! Alone at last! Now for some adventure!" In the third panel, the kangaroo is standing in front of a lion, who is saying "Hm..." The kangaroo is looking up at the lion with a fearful expression. In the fourth panel, the lion is seen with a sly grin on his face, and the text "Hm..." is repeated. The background of the comic features a grassy field with a large tree and a mushroom.
