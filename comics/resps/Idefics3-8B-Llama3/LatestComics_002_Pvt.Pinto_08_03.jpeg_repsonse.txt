The fourth panel shows the man and the woman standing in front of a house, and the man saying "O.K., Lulu!". The fifth panel shows the man and the woman standing in front of a house, and the man saying "If I could just meet that girl, I'll forget that I ever was a crimp!". The sixth panel shows the man and the woman standing in front of a house, and the man saying "The following Sunday is Visiting Day".
