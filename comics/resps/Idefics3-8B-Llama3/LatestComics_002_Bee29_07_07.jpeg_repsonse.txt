The comic book page consists of five panels. In the first panel, a man is falling from the sky and exclaiming "Yipe!" while a woman watches from the ground. In the second panel, the woman is holding a fly swatter and saying "If that pesky fly is all you're worried about, that takes care of him!" In the third panel, a man in a bee costume is saying "That was a deadly term carrying Jap fly!" In the fourth panel, a woman is saying "Whew! Saved from death by a sting in the pants!" In the fifth panel, a man is holding a fly and saying "You're a honey bee! For service above and beyond the call of duty!".
