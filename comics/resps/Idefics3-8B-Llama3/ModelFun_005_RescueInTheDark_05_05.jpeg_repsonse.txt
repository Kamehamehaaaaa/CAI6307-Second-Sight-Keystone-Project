The comic book page consists of six rectangular panels. In the first panel, a man is standing in the woods, looking up at something off-panel. He says, "Follow it...see where it lands!" In the second panel, the man is running through the woods, looking back over his shoulder. He says, "I tell you, I saw it head in that direction!" In the third panel, the man is standing in a clearing, looking around. He says, "I found it!" In the fourth panel, a group of men are standing around a car, looking at a map. One of them says, "Let's go...and this little plane deserves all the credit." In the fifth panel, a man is standing in a bar, talking to another man. He says, "So I tell you, Bobby...like there's gold in them hills, there's gold in model planes and flying." In the sixth panel, a man is standing in a field, looking up at a plane. He says, "Hey, gang! The fog's lifted!" The art style is simple and cartoonish, with thick lines and bright colors. The characters are all men, and they are all wearing hats. The setting is mostly outdoors, with woods, fields, and a bar. The tone of the comic is adventurous and exciting.
