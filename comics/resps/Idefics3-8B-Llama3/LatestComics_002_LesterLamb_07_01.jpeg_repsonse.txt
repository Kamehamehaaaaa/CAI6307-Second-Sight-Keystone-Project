The image is a comic book page titled "Lester Lamb." The page is divided into four panels, each containing a different scene. The first panel shows a little girl with blonde hair and a red dress, standing outside a butcher shop. She is holding a paper bag and looking inside the shop. The butcher shop has a sign that reads "Lester Lamb Butcher Shop" and a signboard advertising "Special Today: Lamb Chops." The second panel shows the little girl inside the shop, talking to the butcher, who is wearing a white apron and a hat. The third panel shows the little girl running outside, holding a paper bag, and the butcher chasing after her. The fourth panel shows the little girl and the butcher standing outside the shop, with the butcher holding a paper bag and the little girl looking at him with a surprised expression. 

In the bottom left corner of the page, there is a small text box with the words "Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow..." The text is written in a cursive font. In the bottom right corner, there is a small text box with the words "JCA" written in a bold font. 

The background of the page is a light yellow color, and the text is in black and red. The characters are drawn in a cartoon style, with exaggerated features and simple lines. The overall tone of the page is playful and humorous.
