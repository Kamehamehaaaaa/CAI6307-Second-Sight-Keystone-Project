The comic book page shows a scene with several animals, including a bear, a mouse, and an eagle. The bear is wearing a red shirt and is standing on a cliff. The mouse is standing next to the bear and is wearing a blue shirt. The eagle is perched on a branch above the bear and mouse. The bear is saying "Goodness - where are the kids?" The mouse is saying "Huh?". The eagle is saying "Eagles' eggs!". The bear is saying "Yoo-hoo! Jasper Wilbur!". The mouse is saying "Omigosh... I bet they're out climbing trees!".
