The woman is responding, "I understand." The second panel shows the man and the woman walking through a forest. The man is saying, "Come on, sweetie, we're going for a walk in the country." The third panel shows the man and the woman standing on a cliff. The man is saying, "It's no use, I can't do it." The woman is saying, "I'll sneak away. Maybe I'll get lost or fall off the cliff or be eaten by a bear or get struck by lightning." The fourth panel shows the man and the woman standing in front of a sign that says, "In a few days, Snoo use discovers that she is lost." The man is saying, "Help! I'm lost." The woman is saying, "This way to Buenos Aires." The image is drawn in a cartoon style, with exaggerated features and bright colors.
