But if I can get those bozos to fire their guns, the scouts from Baker Company will know something is up!" In the background, there is a tank and a soldier. The second panel shows a soldier saying "Then starts a fantastic battle with the steel monsters after this elusive torpedo...". In the background, there is a tank and a soldier. The third panel shows a soldier saying "Rat-tat-tat! Rat-tat-tat!" with an explosion in the background. The fourth panel shows a soldier saying "Got four grenades left, then come on, babies! And let's hear those guns go good and loud!" with a soldier in the background. The fifth panel shows a soldier saying "Meanwhile, at the scene of the skirmish, a dirty, bedraggled, exhausted figure hurries across the line...". In the background, there is a soldier and a tank. The sixth panel shows a soldier saying "Cap'n, Cap'n King, Burgoyne, there's tanks... and a field phone, Joe!" with a soldier in the background.
