The comic book page consists of six panels. In the first panel, a green creature with a bow tie and a hat is standing in front of a large green monster. The creature is saying, "Forgive me, Mr. Dwagon! I didn't mean to bump you!" The monster is saying, "Ouch!" In the second panel, the creature is running away from the monster. In the third panel, the creature is saying, "Good gawvy! I knocked him out!" In the fourth panel, the creature is standing in front of a group of small creatures. The creature is saying, "You can stop hiding now. You don't have to be afraid of the Dwagon's out cold!" In the fifth panel, the creature is saying, "Yer I guess we fixed the big Lummox! Brann Da's me-pitcher, Johnny." In the sixth panel, the creature is saying, "D-don't L-look now, Spike, but I think the Critter's wakin' up!"
