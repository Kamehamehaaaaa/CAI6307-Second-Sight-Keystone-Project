The comic book page is titled "Helpful Herbert" and is written by Rastford. The page is divided into four panels. In the first panel, a man is talking to a woman on the beach. The man is saying, "If I take a walk down to the beach, I'll find somebody that needs help." The woman is saying, "I'm always happy when I'm helping somebody." In the second panel, the man is walking on the beach and sees a woman blowing up a beach ball. The woman is saying, "It takes a lot of wind to blow these things up." The man is saying, "Yes, it does." In the third panel, the man is watching a woman and a dog on the beach. The woman is saying, "I think that's big enough." The man is saying, "Oh, gosh--I've got plenty more where that came from!" In the fourth panel, the man is holding a large, orange camel. The woman is saying, "What in the world is that?" The man is saying, "Yes, it does."
