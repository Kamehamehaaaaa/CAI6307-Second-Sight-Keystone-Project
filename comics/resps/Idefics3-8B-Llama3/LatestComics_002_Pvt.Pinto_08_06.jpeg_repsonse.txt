The comic book page consists of five panels. In the first panel, there is a large cannon on a field. A woman is standing next to the cannon, and she is saying, "What a break! With that A.A. gun, I can operate the remote control system and knock down those planes!" In the second panel, the woman is running away from the cannon. She is saying, "I saw pictures of this device now where is the button?" In the third panel, the woman is standing in front of a control panel. She is saying, "Gulp! Our planes make a personal appearance!" In the fourth panel, a man is saying, "She's gonna blow it up!" In the fifth panel, the woman is saying, "Oh no!" There is an explosion in the background.
