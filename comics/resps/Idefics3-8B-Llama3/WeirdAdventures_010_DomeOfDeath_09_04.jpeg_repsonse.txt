It's... it's murder... we can't let it get mixed up for the children's sake! Why... why don't even know if that machine really works!" In the third panel, a man and a woman are standing in front of a train. The man is saying "Good grief! They smashed up the dispatcher's office and smashed up the switchboard!" The woman is saying "But... but how did they do it? They didn't even know if that machine really works!" In the fourth panel, a man is saying "Wow! Call the dispatcher! They're going to think it's a holdup!" In the fifth panel, a man is saying "On the state highway, Mike, look! A crackup! But Mike... stop! She was there!"
