There are two monsters flying in the background. In the second panel, a man is saying, "Help! Somebody save me!" He is tied up and hanging from a cliff. In the third panel, a man is saying, "Oh, my gootness, smilin' Edâ€”I'm supposed to go first!" There is a mountain in the background. In the fourth panel, a man is saying, "Even I can't get up there.
