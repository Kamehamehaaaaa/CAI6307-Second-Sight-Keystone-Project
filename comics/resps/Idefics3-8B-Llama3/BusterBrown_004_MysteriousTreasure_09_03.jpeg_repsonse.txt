The image is a comic book page featuring a scene set on a body of water, likely a sea or ocean, with a sailboat prominently displayed. The sailboat is depicted with a red hull and yellow sails, and it is shown from a side view, with the sails billowing in the wind. The boat is moving forward, and the waves around it suggest a moderate wind and sea conditions.

In the background, there is a small island with green vegetation and a sandy beach. The island appears to be uninhabited or sparsely populated, with no visible structures or people on its surface. The sky above is clear with a few scattered clouds, indicating fair weather.

The comic page is divided into several panels, each containing different scenes and characters. The first panel on the left shows a man and a woman standing on a dock, looking towards the sea. The man is wearing a yellow shirt and a hat, and he appears to be speaking to the woman, who is wearing a blue dress. The text in this panel reads: "Once in the cove at Bandara and Green, the 'Sunkin' Island' was easily located and anchored nearby, but before they could begin salvage operations..." This suggests that the characters are on a mission to salvage something, possibly a shipwreck.

The second panel shows a close-up of the man's face, looking towards the sea, with a determined expression. The text in this panel reads: "Look! Natives!" This indicates that the characters have spotted something or someone in the water.

The third panel shows a man in a yellow shirt, standing on the deck of the sailboat, looking towards the island. He is holding a binoculars to his eyes. The text in this panel reads: "Go away! Island for white men!" This suggests that the man is observing something on the island, possibly a person or a group of people.

The fourth panel shows a close-up of a man's face, looking towards the island with a concerned expression. The text in this panel reads: "Taro? Where? Why?" This indicates that the man is asking a question, possibly about the island or the people on it.
