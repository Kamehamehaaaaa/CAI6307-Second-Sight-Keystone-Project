The second panel shows the boy approaching a large tree. He is walking towards the tree, and the elephant is following him. The background features more trees and a mountainous landscape. The caption above the panel reads, "At last he finds Padmahi!"

The third panel shows the boy and the elephant standing under a tree. The boy is holding a hook, and the elephant is looking down at him. The background features a river and more trees. The caption above the panel reads, "Gunga quickly fastens the keddah hook with practiced hands."

The fourth panel shows the boy and the elephant walking together. The boy is leading the elephant, and the elephant is walking calmly. The background features more trees and a mountainous landscape. The caption above the panel reads, "And Padmahi is captured!"
