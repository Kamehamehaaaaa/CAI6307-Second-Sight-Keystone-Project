The comic strip depicts a series of humorous interactions between two cartoon bears. The first frame shows the bears in a snowy environment, with one bear exclaiming "Aha! So that's it!" as it holds a hammer and appears to be hitting another bear on the head with it. The second frame shows the bear who was hit lying on the ground, exclaiming "Wham!" and "Bang!" as it holds its head in pain. The third frame shows the first bear saying "Yee-owwww!" as it stands over the injured bear. The fourth frame shows the injured bear saying "That does it. Now to sleep to spring!" as it lies in a bed, suggesting that the first bear has finally managed to put the injured bear to sleep. The fifth frame shows the first bear saying "Gar-gh!" as it holds a pair of scissors and appears to be cutting the injured bear's hair. The sixth frame shows the injured bear saying "Now what?" as it looks at its newly shorn hair. The seventh frame shows the first bear saying "Chop! Chop! Chop!" as it continues to cut the injured bear's hair. The eighth and final frame shows the injured bear saying "Chop! Chop! Chop!" as it looks at its completely shorn hair.
