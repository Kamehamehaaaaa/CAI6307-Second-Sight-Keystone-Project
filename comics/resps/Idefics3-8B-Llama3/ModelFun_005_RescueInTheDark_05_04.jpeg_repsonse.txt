The second panel shows a group of people standing in a field, looking at a plane. One of them is saying, "I know, let's lash the pencil-type flashlight to the plane." The third panel shows a man standing in a field, looking at a plane. He is saying, "There she goes... I can't make it out anymore. It's too dark!" The fourth panel shows a man standing in a field, looking at a plane. He is saying, "It must still be flying. Let's signal those on the other shore." The fifth panel shows a man standing in a field, looking at a plane. He is saying, "On the other side of the river, they signalled. A power model plane is coming over." The sixth panel shows a man standing in a field, looking at a plane. He is saying, "It's passing over us... it's pretty high."
