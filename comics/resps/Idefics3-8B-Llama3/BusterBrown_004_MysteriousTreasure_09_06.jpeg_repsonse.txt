The comic book page has three columns of text and images. The first column has a ship with people on it. The second column has a man holding a gun and another man holding a knife. The third column has a man talking to another man. The text in the first column says "After 24 hours of hard work, Kala and Chad slept soundly, unaware of their rapidly approaching visitors next to the 'Sea Hawk' floats the mysterious ship...". The text in the second column says "Come on, boys! We've taken them by surprise...". The text in the third column says "Okay, post a man on deck to get him when he comes back; c'mon, Bilow, over on the 'Swift' and make it fast.".
