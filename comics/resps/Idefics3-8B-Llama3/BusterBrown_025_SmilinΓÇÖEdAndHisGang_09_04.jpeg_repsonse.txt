The comic book page consists of six panels. The first panel shows a frog wearing a red shirt and a hat, with a speech bubble saying "I'm an eagle, I am, I am!" The frog is holding onto a rope with a cat on the other end. The cat is wearing a red scarf and has a surprised expression on its face. In the second panel, the frog is saying "My gootness, Smilin' Ed, did you schlip?" The frog is looking at the cat, who is looking up at the frog. In the third panel, a man with a long beard and a green shirt is saying "Yowp!" while holding onto a rope with a frog on the other end. The frog is wearing a red shirt and a hat. In the fourth panel, the man is saying "Smilin' Ed, are you hurt?" The frog is looking at the man with a surprised expression. In the fifth panel, the man is saying "No, but I think I've had enough mountain climbing. We'll never reach the top!" The frog is looking at the man with a determined expression. In the sixth panel, the man is saying "I'm gonna butt some body!" The frog is looking at the man with a mischievous expression.
