- **Text:** The text bubble above the man's head reads, "WE SHALL LEAVE TONIGHT?" The woman's text bubble reads, "WHAT... WHAT... HAPPENED?"

### Panel 2:
- **Description:** The same man and woman are in a different scene, possibly outside or in a different room. The man is holding a briefcase, and the woman is looking at him with a worried expression.

### Panel 3:
