The image is a comic book page, divided into six rectangular panels. The panels are arranged in two rows and three columns. Each panel contains a different scene, and they are connected by speech bubbles with text inside them. 

In the first panel, there is a man in a suit and a woman in a dress standing in front of a car. The man is saying, "That car's going to run over him!" The car is red and is driving towards a man who is standing in the street. 

In the second panel, the man is saying, "John, are you all right?" The woman is responding, "Yes, I'm fine." There is a man in a hat and trench coat standing next to them. 

In the third panel, there is a man in a suit and a woman in a dress standing in front of a car. The man is saying, "It wasn't a lightning bolt that hit the car, Jane. It was a ray gun!" The woman is saying, "Oh, I see." 

In the fourth panel, there is a man in a suit and a woman in a dress standing in front of a car. The man is saying, "How can I expect her to believe what I saw?" The woman is saying, "You go right home and lie down for a while, darling." 

In the fifth panel, there is a man in a suit and a woman in a dress standing in front of a car. The man is saying, "I can't get that strange feeling out of my mind. Did I really see her demolish that car with a ray gun?" The woman is saying, "Or was it all a hallucination?" 

In the sixth panel, there is a man in a suit and a woman in a dress standing in front of a car. The man is saying, "I'm going to find out what really happened." The woman is saying, "I'm going with you." 

The text in the speech bubbles is written in a casual, conversational style, and the characters are depicted in a cartoonish manner. The overall tone of the comic is one of mystery and intrigue, with the characters trying to figure out what happened to the car and the woman.
