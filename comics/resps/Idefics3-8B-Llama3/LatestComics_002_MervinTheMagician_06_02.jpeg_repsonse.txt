The image is a comic book page featuring four panels. The first panel shows a lion wearing a red hat and a blue bow tie, holding a magic wand and standing in front of a curtain. The lion is saying, "Too bad we can't give some of this corn to our allies/ well, folks, let's get on with the show!" The second panel shows a magician performing a magic trick, with a woman in a red dress and a man in a blue shirt watching. The magician is saying, "I'll now perform a feat of magic which I learned on my trip to India!" The third panel shows a woman in a red dress and a man in a blue shirt watching a magic show, with the magician saying, "I'm going to make this beautiful girl vanish!" The fourth panel shows the magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, with the text "Cidamo!!" written above it. The magician is saying, "She has disappeared! The gods of her valley have taken her away, but she shall be back - she has to be, we have to show to-night!" The background of the comic book page is white, and the text is in black. The characters are drawn in a cartoon style, with exaggerated features and bright colors.
