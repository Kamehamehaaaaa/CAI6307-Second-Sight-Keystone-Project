The comic book page consists of four panels. In the first panel, a man is holding a tube and a man is standing in the water. The first man is saying, "It's worth a try... remember this serum is valuable, will." In the second panel, a man is standing in the water and a boy is standing on the shore. The man is saying, "A few minutes later... she'll make it across the river for sure." In the third panel, a man is standing in front of a plane and a boy is standing next to him. The man is saying, "I get the idea. Let's try it another way." In the fourth panel, a man is standing in front of a plane and a boy is standing next to him. The man is saying, "With the serum tube taped to its body, the tiny model plane begins to fly when the wind catches it and it's spinning out of control!"
