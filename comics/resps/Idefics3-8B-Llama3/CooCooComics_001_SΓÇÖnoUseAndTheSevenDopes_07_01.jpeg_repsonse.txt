The image is a page from a comic book. The title at the top of the page reads "S'NO USE" and "AND THE SEVEN DOPE." Below the title, there is a banner that reads "ALL THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS SORDID STORY ARE SUPERFLUOUS AND ENTIRELY MALICIOUS!" The page is divided into three main sections, each containing a different scene.

The first section, on the left side of the page, shows a man looking into a mirror. He is wearing a green suit and a crown. The mirror is reflecting an image of a woman, who is also wearing a green suit and a crown. The woman is saying, "YOUR STEP-DAUGHTER SNO USE, SHE'S SOME KID, SHE'S PRETTY LIKE ANYTHING." The man is responding with a surprised expression, saying, "WHAT?"

The second section, in the middle of the page, shows a man in a green suit and a crown, standing in front of a curtain. He is saying, "I'LL GET RID OF THAT BRAT, NO KID'S GONNA MAKE A MONKEY OUT OF ME." The man is holding a cane and looking towards the curtain.

The third section, on the right side of the page, shows a man in a green suit and a crown, standing in front of a curtain. He is saying, "AH! SO YOU'RE WONDERING TOO!" The man is looking towards the curtain, and there is a surprised expression on his face.

The background of the page is a light yellow color, and the text is in black. The characters are drawn in a cartoon style, with exaggerated features and expressions. The overall tone of the page is humorous and playful.
