The comic book page is titled "Lester!" and consists of six panels. The first panel shows a girl with blonde hair and a red dress, standing in front of a tree, looking at a boy with a red hat and blue shirt. The boy is saying, "I can't bear to sniff him, he was such a nice lamb... even if he was a nuisance!" The second panel shows the girl with a shocked expression on her face, saying, "It was positively to scare me like that!" The third panel shows the boy with a sheepish expression on his face, saying, "I guess I'm a lamb who's always in a stew." The fourth panel shows the girl with a surprised expression on her face, saying, "Oh, oh... that Mr. Havocsh, he's always talking for hours!" The fifth panel shows a man with a mustache and a top hat, saying, "I didn't mean...". The sixth panel shows the boy with a sheepish expression on his face, saying, "Not a bad pressing job, eh?" The background of the comic book page includes a tree, a fence, and a dog.
