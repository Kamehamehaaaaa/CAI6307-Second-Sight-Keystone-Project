The comic book page is titled "Wingless Test-Pilots!" and features a dramatic scene of a jet plane crashing into the ocean. The plane is depicted in mid-crash, with its wings and tail fin broken off, and it is sending up a large plume of water as it hits the waves. The pilot is shown in a rescue boat, looking up at the plane in shock and fear, with the caption "Something's gone wrong! The plane is crashing!" above him. 

In the background, there is a small island with a few trees and a road, and a truck is driving along the road. The truck is labeled "U.S. Marines" and has a large, red star on the side. 

The rescue boat is being rowed by two men, both of whom are wearing military uniforms. The man in the front of the boat is shouting "Hurry, before the plane doesn't look too badly damaged!" The man in the back of the boat is responding with "Sure, could have been a lot worse!" 

The page is drawn in a classic comic book style, with bold lines and bright colors. The characters are all drawn in a cartoonish way, with exaggerated features and expressions. The overall tone of the page is one of action and suspense, as the reader is left wondering what will happen next to the pilot and the plane.
