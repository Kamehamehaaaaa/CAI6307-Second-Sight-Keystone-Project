The second panel shows the man and the woman walking through a forest, with the man carrying a rope. The third panel shows the man and the woman standing near a tree, with the man saying, "Now I do not see Padman. The elephants stand so closely together that I cannot recognize her." The fourth panel shows the man and the woman walking through a grassy area, with the man saying, "That will make it more difficult. I will have to search for her." The fifth panel shows the man and the woman standing near a tree, with the man saying, "Gunga... be careful. I still feel we should stop you from going." The sixth panel shows the man and the woman walking through a forest, with the man saying, "We will keep it running smoothly, Gunga. But should an elephant discover your presence, I do not know what we can do." The background of the panels features various elements such as trees, plants, and animals, including an elephant. The text is written in a speech bubble format, with the dialogue indicating a conversation between the characters. The characters' expressions and body language suggest a sense of urgency and concern.
