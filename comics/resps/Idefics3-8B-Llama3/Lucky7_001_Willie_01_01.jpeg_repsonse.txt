**Panel 2:**

The comic strip is drawn in a simple, cartoon style with bright colors and exaggerated features. The characters are depicted with large heads and eyes, and the expressions are exaggerated for comedic effect. The background is a green field with a few houses and trees. The text is written in a speech bubble above each character's head.
