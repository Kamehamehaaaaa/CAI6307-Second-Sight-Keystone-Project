The comic book page opens with a muscular purple figure, identified as Jinn, standing before a man in traditional attire. Jinn, once mighty, now commands the cord of magic around his waist, declaring himself master. He issues a command to transform into a stallion, promising swift travel from Bassorah to Baghdad. The scene shifts to show the transformation taking place, with a black horse emerging amidst a burst of smoke and flames, indicating the magical change.

As the stallion gallops swiftly across the landscape, the narrative reveals that Karim, the man in traditional attire, is narrating the story to Jafarah, the beautiful princess Myrrah's father. The setting is a desert town, with Karim explaining how he and Myrrah were to be married when her father, the Great Caliph, objected. The Caliphâ€™s Wazir, Bele Kahr, a magician, conspired with Jinn to place a spell on Karim, turning him into an eagle.

The page continues with Karim recounting that if the cord were tied around his waist, he would become the master. Determined, they plan to meet the wicked Wazir and rescue Myrrah. The final panel shows Karim and Jafarah discussing their strategy, with Jafarah expressing concern about getting past the guards. Karim responds with confidence, stating he has a plan but first needs another change for their Jinn. The background depicts a bustling town square, adding to the urgency and tension of their mission.
