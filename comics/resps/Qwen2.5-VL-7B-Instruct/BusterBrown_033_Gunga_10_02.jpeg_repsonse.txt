The comic book page depicts a scene set within the Maharajah's Palace, where Rama is preparing to give another lesson to Baby "Tusker," the pet of everyone in the palace. Tusker, an elephant, is being trained by Rama, who is instructing him on the virtue of patience. The dialogue reveals that Tusker is learning well, as he pulls a small bullock cart efficiently.

In the next panel, Rama mentions that Tusker will take them for a ride during the Dasara parade. The setting shifts slightly as Rama and another character discuss Tusker's progress, noting that he learns quickly and reminding them of Babu, another elephant they have been training. Babu was having trouble with Padmah, the big cow elephant, who had been acting very badly and was even more unruly than usual that day. Rama suggests that Tusker might help Babu, and the final panel shows Tusker pulling a cart, with one character urging Padmah to calm down, using the phrase "Down, Padmah!" indicating an attempt to control her behavior.
