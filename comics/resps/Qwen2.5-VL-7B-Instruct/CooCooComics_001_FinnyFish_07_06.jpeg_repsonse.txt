The comic book page features a humorous adventure involving anthropomorphic animal characters. The story begins with a character named Finny, who is searching for treasure after finding a dinosaur. He suggests hiding marbles in a cave to pass off as treasure, which he believes will trick his friends into thinking he found the real treasure. Finny's plan is to keep them busy while he retrieves the marbles, ensuring they don't suspect anything amiss.

In the next panel, Finny's friend Goatie expresses skepticism about the treasure hunt, suggesting that Finny might not have found anything valuable. This dialogue highlights the playful tension between the characters. Finny, however, remains confident and determined, planning to deceive his friends by pretending to find treasure.

The scene shifts to Finny and Goatie searching through a cave, where Finny pretends to discover something valuable. Meanwhile, Finny instructs his other friend Spike to keep Finny's friends occupied outside the cave. This setup allows Finny to return to the cave and retrieve the marbles, maintaining the illusion of having found treasure.

The final panels show Finny emerging from the cave, now holding the marbles, and confidently telling his friends that he has found the treasure. His friends, Goatie and Finny, are left confused and slightly amused by the situation. The comic concludes with a light-hearted tone, emphasizing the comedic nature of Finny's scheme and the playful dynamics among the characters.
