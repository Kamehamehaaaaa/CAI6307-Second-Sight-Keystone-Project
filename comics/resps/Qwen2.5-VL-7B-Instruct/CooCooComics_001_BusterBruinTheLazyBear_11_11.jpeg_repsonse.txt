The comic book page features a sequence of six panels involving a bear character and a smaller dog-like character. The story begins with the bear, dressed in an orange outfit, lying in bed, seemingly asleep. The smaller character, who appears to be a dog, is seen adjusting a large alarm clock labeled "Spring" and "Fall," with the caption "It's all set to go off. Quick, back to bed!" indicating urgency.

In the second panel, the alarm clock rings loudly, and the bear, now awake, looks confused, with the caption "Huh?" suggesting he is not sure what has happened.

The third panel shows the bear stretching and exclaiming, "Ahhh! Spring! I feel great! Nothing like a good long nap!" This indicates that despite the alarm, the bear is enjoying the change of seasons.

In the fourth panel, the bear is seen getting out of bed, saying, "Now to get some sun again ----" showing his enthusiasm for the sunny weather.

The fifth panel captures a moment where the bear is startled by something falling from above, with the smaller character and another bear-like figure reacting with surprise, indicated by the speech bubble "Hey!! W-what th--!"

The final panel depicts the bear sitting in a bucket filled with water, looking distressed, with the smaller character and the other bear-like figure laughing, and the bear saying "Har-umph! Ker-choo!" This suggests the bear has been splashed or drenched, possibly due to the falling object, and is now trying to recover.

Throughout the comic, the interactions between the characters and their environment highlight the bear's initial reluctance to wake up, his subsequent enjoyment of spring, and the humorous consequences of the seasonal change.
