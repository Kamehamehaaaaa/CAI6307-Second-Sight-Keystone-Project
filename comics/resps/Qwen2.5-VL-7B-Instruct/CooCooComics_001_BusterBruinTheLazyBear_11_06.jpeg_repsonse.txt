The comic book page features a series of six panels depicting a nighttime scene involving three bears. The first panel shows the two smaller bears, one gray and one brown, lying in bed with green bedding, clearly agitated, as indicated by their exclamations "WAH!" and "EEYOW!" The larger bear, presumably the father, is sitting up in bed, looking concerned.

In the second panel, the father bear, now wearing an orange nightshirt, is seen leaning over the bed, saying "GO TO SLEEP!" to his children, who remain awake and restless.

The third panel captures the children's plea, "TELL US A STORY FIRST, PAPA!" as they look expectantly at their father, who appears to be contemplating their request.

The fourth panel reveals the father bear sitting on a chair beside the bed, holding a storybook. He begins to read, "ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE BEARS----" while the children, still in their pajamas, listen attentively.

In the fifth panel, the father continues the bedtime story, "----AND THE LITTLE BEAR SAID: ZZZZ-ZZZZ," as the children, now appearing more relaxed, lean in closer to hear the tale.

The final panel shows the father bear, still reading, with the children whispering "PSST!" to each other, indicating that they might be about to interrupt or share a secret, adding a touch of playful mischief to the otherwise serene bedtime setting.
