The comic book page opens with a character, Puff, who is initially mistaken for a cave but is actually a sleeping whale with its mouth open. Puff expresses surprise at the discovery, exclaiming "Huh?" as he peers into the whale's cavernous mouth. The setting is a whimsical landscape with trees and a clear sky, suggesting an outdoor adventure.

In the next panel, Puff is seen running away from the whale, which is now awake and roaring, indicated by the sound effects "ZIP ZIP ZIP." Puff's urgency is evident as he shouts "Lemme out... of here!" while dodging the whale's teeth.

The narrative shifts to a group of characters, including Finny, who has returned safely. Puff greets Finny with concern, asking if he was scared or not, to which Finny responds with relief, "I'm so glad you're safe! Why did you stay behind?" Finny explains that he stayed to retrieve beautiful stones from the whale's mouth, noting that the whale didn't even wake up during the process.

The scene transitions to a village where Finny proudly displays a sack filled with gold coins, having retrieved them from the whale's teeth. The villagers are excited, with one character exclaiming, "Oh my gosh! Gold! He picked de fillings out of de whale's teeth! See, Finny, ya pound de treasure after all!" Finny confirms, "That's right! I guess I did! And I found it first! So you owe me 25 cents on the bet we made!"

The final panels show Finny being playfully kicked by the villagers, who are now celebrating their newfound wealth. One character demands, "Go ahead -- kick me! Don't ask no questions... just kick me! I deserve it!" The comic concludes with a banner reading "THE END," marking the resolution of the adventure.
