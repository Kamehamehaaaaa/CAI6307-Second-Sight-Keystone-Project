The comic book page features a humorous interaction between anthropomorphic animals in a snowy forest setting. The first panel shows a bear lying on the ground, seemingly asleep or resting, with a tree trunk behind him. The second panel introduces three chipmunks who are sitting on a log, looking at the bear and exclaiming, "Hey! What's goin' on here?" The third panel reveals that the chipmunks are planning to chop down the tree they're sitting on, explaining, "We gotta chop down this tree --- we're building a dam!" The bear, now awake and dressed in an orange shirt, responds to their noisy activity by saying, "Well, be a little more quiet about it!" In the fourth panel, the bear is seen walking away while one of the chipmunks holds up a popsicle, suggesting a break from their work. The fifth panel captures the bear lying down again, with the chipmunk saying, "Thass better--" The final panel shows the bear standing next to the fallen tree, with the chipmunk exclaiming, "TIMBER!" The comic humorously depicts the chaos and miscommunication between the characters as they attempt to build a dam.
