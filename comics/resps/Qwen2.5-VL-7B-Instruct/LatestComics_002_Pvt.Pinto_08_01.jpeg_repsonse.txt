The comic book page titled "PVT. PINTO" opens with a serene outdoor setting under a tree, where a soldier in a green uniform is lying on a wooden bench, engaging in a conversation with a woman dressed in a red dress and pearls. The soldier, with a slightly disheveled appearance, asks, "Ain't it romantic here under the tree?" The woman, seated beside him, responds with a smile, her hand gently resting on his. The scene captures a moment of quiet intimacy amidst nature.

In the next panel, the soldier, now standing, exclaims "MAIL!" as he rushes towards a tent, indicating an urgent need for communication or a package. The final panel shows chaos as the soldier crashes into a group of soldiers, causing a commotion marked by the sounds "CRASH! BANG! SOCK!" The soldiers around him appear startled and scattered, adding a humorous twist to the otherwise tranquil setting. The comic effectively contrasts the peacefulness of the initial scene with the sudden disruption caused by the unexpected arrival of mail.
