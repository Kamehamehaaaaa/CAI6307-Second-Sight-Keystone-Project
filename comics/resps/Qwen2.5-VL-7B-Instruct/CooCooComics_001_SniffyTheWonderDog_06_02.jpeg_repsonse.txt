The comic book page opens with a man in a blue suit and orange vest expressing sympathy for a dog labeled "For Sale," saying, "Ah-hh! The poor little feller..." Suddenly, the dog barks, "Wah!" The scene shifts to another man, also in a blue suit but with a red vest, admiring a small dog, commenting, "Nice doggie..." He then exclaims, "Sweet little feller... I'm gonna buy him!!" 

In the next panel, the first man is seen holding the dog, now with a question mark above his head, indicating confusion or surprise. The second man, now wearing a top hat, gently places the dog on a counter, and the first man responds with a "Smack!" sound effect.

The narrative continues with the first man, now visibly distressed, exclaiming, "Oh-oh! The wife doesn't like dogs!" He looks at a clown-like figure behind a counter, who seems to be the shopkeeper. The clown, with a striped collar, warns, "Poof!!! Snap!"

The first man, still holding the dog, runs away, exclaiming, "Huh! Oops!" The clown follows, shouting, "Bang!" The first man turns back, looking surprised, and says, "I'd like to buy that dog!" The shopkeeper, confused, replies, "Dog? What dog?" The final panel shows the first man, now in a panic, running away again, while the shopkeeper looks bewildered.
