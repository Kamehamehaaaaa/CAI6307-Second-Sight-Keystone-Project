The comic book page opens with a scene of a young boy, Allie, chasing a girl across a grassy field. The girl, dressed in a polka-dotted dress, is running away from him. The setting appears to be a suburban neighborhood with a house and tree visible in the background. In the next panel, an older man, presumably Allie's father, is seen shouting "ALLIE!" from behind a wooden fence.

In the following panels, the father approaches Allie, who is now standing on the road. The father asks, "ALLIE-- WHY ARE YOU CHASING GIRLS?" to which Allie responds, "I LIKE TO TEASE THEM!" The father seems taken aback but then says, "OH, YOU DO?" and Allie confirms, "YES-- IT'S GOOD FUN!"

The final two panels show the father telling Allie that when he gets home, he'll find their dog gone because he gave him to the pound. Allie looks surprised and says "WAAA." In the last panel, the father kneels down to Allie, who is now crying, and says, "SEE-- I WAS JUST TEASING YOU-- YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DO YOU?" Allie replies, "PAPA-- I'LL HAVE TO SPANK YOU WHEN WE GET HOME-- YOU TOLD A BIG LIE!" The comic ends with the father looking confused and Allie still crying. The artist's signature, "MARK POST," is visible in the bottom right corner.
