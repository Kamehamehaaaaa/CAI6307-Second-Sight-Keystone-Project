The comic book page opens with a snowy mountainous setting where a group of anthropomorphic characters, including a cat and a dog dressed in winter gear, are engaged in a perilous climb. The cat, named Smilin' Ed, is leading the way, but the dog, Goink, is trailing behind, exclaiming, "Hey! Vere are you goink?" The cat, however, is too busy to respond, focusing on the steep incline ahead.

In the second panel, the dog, Goink, is seen hanging from a rope, desperately calling out, "Smilin' Ed -- wait for me! I'm supposed to go first!" The cat, still climbing, remains unresponsive, highlighting his leadership role despite the chaos.

The third panel shows the dog, Goink, now at the bottom of the mountain, looking up in distress, saying, "Help!... Somebody save me!" The cat, now at the top, looks down with a triumphant expression, declaring, "Even I can't get up there. I'm going home!"

In the final panel, the cat, now at the top, finds a toboggan lying on the ground. He exclaims, "Oh, my gootness, Smilin' Ed -- we are so lucky: somebody left a toboggan lying here. Now we don't have to walk." The dog, Goink, is seen at the bottom, looking up with a hopeful expression, saying, "I hope I can sit on it!" The cat, however, is cautious, stating, "I'm afraid this toboggan will go too fast. I'd better anchor it."

The page captures a humorous and adventurous moment among the characters, emphasizing themes of teamwork, leadership, and the unexpected solutions to problems.
