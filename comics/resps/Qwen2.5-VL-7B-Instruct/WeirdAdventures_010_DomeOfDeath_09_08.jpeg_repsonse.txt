The comic book page opens with a tense scene inside a room where two men are engaged in a heated argument. One man, wearing a blue suit, is seated on the floor, while the other, dressed in a white shirt, leans over him, his hand raised as if to strike. The dialogue reveals their frustration and determination: "NEVER MIND THAT! ANNA'S GONE OFF TO TURN OFF THE MACHINE... WE GOT TO STOP HER! THIS BIG APE IS DEAD ANYWAY!" The man in the blue suit retorts, "BUT JOE IS WRONG! THERE IS A SPARK OF STRENGTH LEFT IN SWEDE'S GREAT BODY—THAT DAME... I'LL KILL HER! MY OWN SISTER CROSSING ME..."

The scene shifts to a rooftop where a man in a white shirt and brown pants is seen from behind, looking out at the cityscape. He exclaims, "POLICE? GO TO THE ROOF OF... ARROW BUILDING! MACHINE THAT CONTROLS THE DOME IS THERE! HURRY! IT'S TRUE—I TELL YOU! YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME! YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE N—" His voice trails off as he turns to face another man who is also on the roof. The second man, with blonde hair, is bent over, seemingly working on something. The dialogue continues, "AND MEANWHILE... THERE SHE IS, JOE!"

The narrative then moves to a different setting where a woman in a yellow blouse and red plaid skirt is seen from behind, walking towards a machine. She reaches for a dial and turns it, saying, "THERE! NOW TURN THIS DIAL, AND THEN JUST ONE MORE MOVE—OHHHHHH!"

The final panel shows the woman in the yellow blouse standing in front of the machine, which has been turned off. She exclaims, "SHE'S TRICKED US, YOU DOPE! SHE'S TURNED OFF THE MACHINE! GET HER!" Two men, one in a blue suit and the other in a white shirt, rush towards her, indicating a sense of urgency and relief.

Throughout the page, the interactions between the characters are filled with tension, urgency, and a clear sense of a high-stakes situation involving a machine that controls a dome. The dialogue and expressions convey a narrative of betrayal, determination, and the race against time.
