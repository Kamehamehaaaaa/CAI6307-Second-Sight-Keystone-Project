The comic book page opens with a tense scene where a man in a suit is speaking to two women, one in a green outfit and the other in red. The dialogue reveals a sense of urgency and fear, with the man saying, "We shall leave tonight!" and the woman in red responding, "What... what... happened?" The setting appears to be indoors, possibly a room or a hallway, with a cityscape visible through a window.

The narrative progresses to show the man, John, waiting late that night, filled with dread and foreboding. He encounters Zada, who is dressed in a regal outfit, indicating her importance and power. Zada declares, "I'll go, all right, Zada! But I shall do more than rule your heart! I shall be the one who is master of Xedes... while you will be my thrall... my slave!" This exchange suggests a power struggle and a complex relationship dynamic.

In another panel, Zada continues, "I have come to keep the bargain. Together we shall rule Xedes... and you shall rule my heart! You shall love me... not like the other one who only wanted power!" John responds with a mix of resignation and defiance, saying, "Well... there's nothing to be done, I suppose. I'll go with you!" However, he adds, "But there must be something... some way... wait! I have an idea!"

The tension escalates as Zada, now in a more confrontational stance, exclaims, "You're wrong! You are weak--a woman! Only I have the strength to rule! I don't love you... I love power!" This confrontation highlights the disparity in their motivations and the power imbalance between them.

The final panels depict John's realization and triumph. He declares, "It worked! She's leaving! I've won!" This moment of victory contrasts sharply with Zada's disappointment and frustration, as she cries out, "No... you are not the one I seek! Once more I have met with disappointment! Farewell!" The page concludes with a "The End" caption, marking the resolution of this dramatic encounter.
