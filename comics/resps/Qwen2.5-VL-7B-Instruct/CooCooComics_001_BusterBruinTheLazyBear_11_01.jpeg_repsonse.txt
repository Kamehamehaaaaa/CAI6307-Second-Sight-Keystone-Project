The comic book page features the title "Buster Bruin The Lazy Bear" prominently displayed at the top in bold, orange letters against a green background. The setting is a cozy, rustic cabin interior with wooden logs and a warm, inviting atmosphere. Inside the cabin, Buster Bruin, a brown bear wearing an orange shirt and striped pajama pants, is lying in bed under a yellow blanket. His expression suggests he's just waking up or about to go to sleep.

In the first panel, Buster is seen lying in bed, looking somewhat disinterested. A speech bubble above his head reads, "HO-HUM! IT'S ABOUT TIME I STARTED HIBERNATING FOR THE WINTER!" This indicates Buster's reluctance to start hibernating for winter. The second panel shows Buster sitting up in bed, still appearing unenthusiastic. Another speech bubble emerges from his mouth, stating, "I'LL SET IT FOR SPRING!" This reveals Buster's clever plan to delay his hibernation until spring, demonstrating his characteristic laziness and cleverness.

To the right of the bed, thereâ€™s a small table with various items: a blue alarm clock set to "FALL," a bottle labeled "SLEEPING TABLETS," a box marked "FIRST AID," and a jar labeled "UNIMENT." These items add to the cozy, lived-in feel of the cabin and hint at Buster's preparedness for his long nap. The overall tone of the comic is light-hearted and humorous, capturing Buster's typical antics and his knack for finding ways to avoid work or responsibilities.
