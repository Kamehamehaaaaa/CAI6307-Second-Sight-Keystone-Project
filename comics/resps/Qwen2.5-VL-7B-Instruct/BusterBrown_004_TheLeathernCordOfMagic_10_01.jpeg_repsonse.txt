The comic book page titled "The Leather Cord of Magic" opens with a bustling market scene in the Eastern city of Bassorah under the hot sun. The setting is vibrant, filled with various stalls and merchants engaged in their daily activities. A man, dressed in traditional attire, is seen sitting on the ground, surrounded by baskets and other goods. He is speaking, with a speech bubble that reads, "Basket to hire! Basket to hire! Will no one hire my basket?" This suggests he is trying to sell his wares but is having difficulty finding customers.

The narrative then shifts to a close-up of another character, Little Jafara, who is looking up at an eagle perched in a tree. The text in the speech bubble from Jafara says, "Oh! That eagle! He's caught in the tree! I know! I'll climb up and set him free! At least, he needn't be a prisoner." This indicates Jafara's concern for the eagle and his desire to help it.

In the final panel, we see Jafara climbing the tree to rescue the eagle. The text in the speech bubble reads, "There you are, wild one! You are free to fly away..." This shows the successful outcome of Jafara's efforts to save the bird.

The page concludes with a red box containing a descriptive caption: "The Eastern city of Bassorah basks under the hot sun. The merchants drowse in their stalls. But little Jafara looks for business, for in this ancient Persian city, everyone worked or went hungry... Into this drowsy scene comes the scream of a great eagle to startle little Jafara and turn him from his task!" This sets the context for the story, highlighting the contrast between the usual calmness of the market and the sudden interruption caused by the eagle's cry.
