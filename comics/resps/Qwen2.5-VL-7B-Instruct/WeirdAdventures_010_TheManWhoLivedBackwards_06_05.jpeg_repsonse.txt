The comic book page depicts a dramatic sequence involving two characters, David and Paul, set against the backdrop of a rugged cliffside. The narrative begins with David falling over the edge of the cliff, caught by a bush, while Paul runs towards him to rescue him. However, the story takes an unexpected turn as Paul relives the scene backwards, finding himself lowering David, holding onto his shirt collar, with the intention of saving him.

In the first panel, David is seen tripping and falling, while Paul, dressed in red, is running towards him. The second panel shows Paul holding David's collar, with David's face showing distress. The third panel captures the urgency of the moment as David pleads for help, saying, "Hold tight, David! A little more and I'll pull you up!"

The fourth panel illustrates David slipping further down the cliff, with Paul's silhouette visible in the background, emphasizing the perilous situation. In the fifth panel, Paul is depicted in a state of deep contemplation, questioning his actions and the flow of time, with text such as, "Where did he wander off to? Every time there's work to be done... maybe I ought to look for him?"

The sixth panel shows Paul in a moment of realization, with text indicating his determination: "But what can I do? But wait till tomorrow? That will never come! Wait till it be cold yesterday? Yes, blooded murder! No, I can't do it! I must save him! I must!"

The seventh panel focuses on Paul's emotional turmoil, with sweat beads forming on his forehead, highlighting his internal struggle. The eighth panel captures the climax of the sequence as Paul, now at the edge of the cliff, pleads desperately, "Paul! I'm going! Save me!" The final panel shows Paul falling backward, with David's voice echoing, "Too late! Too late!! David!"

Throughout the page, the interaction between David and Paul is central, with Paul's actions and thoughts driving the narrative forward, culminating in a tragic yet poignant resolution.
