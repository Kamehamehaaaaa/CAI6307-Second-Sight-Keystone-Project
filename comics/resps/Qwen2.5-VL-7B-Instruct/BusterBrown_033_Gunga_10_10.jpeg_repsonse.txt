The comic book page depicts a scene involving three men and an elephant named Padmah in a jungle setting. The first panel shows one of the men, identified as Babu, pointing at the elephant while speaking to another man, Gunga. The dialogue indicates that Babu is commanding Padmah to move back, emphasizing the need for her to learn her lesson. 

In the second panel, Gunga is seen holding a rope, preparing to tie Padmah, with the caption explaining that he and Rama will use the snubbing rope to hold her fast once she is driven back.

The third panel reveals that Gunga has successfully captured Padmah. He is now contemplating what to do next, asking if they should force her to kneel, mount, and ride her back. The other two men, Babu and Rama, assure him that they will be ready with the rope and that they will quickly snub her to a tree if she causes trouble.

In the fourth panel, Babu confirms their readiness, stating, "I am here. We are ready to go." He then asks Gunga how Padmah is behaving, to which Gunga responds, "I think this time she has learned her lesson well. She is quiet."

The final panel concludes the sequence by showing the men preparing to leave, with the caption, "And so the bad elephant, Padmah, learns her lesson," indicating that the elephant has been tamed or disciplined through their actions. The setting remains consistently within the lush, green jungle throughout the panels.
