The comic book page opens with a scene set on the roof of the Arrow Building, where several hours before dawn, a tense conversation unfolds between two men. One man, identified as Mr. Kemal, is holding a ring that contains the formula for operating a machine. The other man, presumably a professor, insists on keeping the secret within the ring. The setting is dimly lit, emphasizing the urgency and secrecy of their exchange.

In the next panel, the professor reveals that the city is covered by an invisible dome of force, making it impossible for anyone to break through. He demands the ring, threatening the man with violence if he doesn't comply. The atmosphere is charged with tension as the professor's resolve is tested.

The narrative shifts to a confrontation involving three men in yellow suits. They are determined to obtain the ring from the professor, who is now visibly agitated. The professor pleads with them not to use his invention, warning them about the consequences. The men, however, are relentless, pushing the professor against a door, ready to take the ring by force.

The tension escalates as the professor, now in a blue suit, is seen being pushed against the same door. The men, still in yellow, continue to demand the ring, their expressions showing a mix of determination and aggression. The professor's desperation is palpable as he tries to fend off the men, shouting out warnings and pleas for help.

In the final panels, the confrontation reaches its climax. The professor, now in a green suit, is seen being pushed against the door once more. The men, still in yellow, are determined to take the ring. The professor's struggle is intense, and the scene ends with him being pushed away, leaving the outcome uncertain. The page concludes with the professor's desperate cry for help, adding to the overall sense of danger and urgency.
