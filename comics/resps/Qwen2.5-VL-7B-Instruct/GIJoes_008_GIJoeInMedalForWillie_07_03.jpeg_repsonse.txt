The comic book page depicts a tense military scenario involving "Baker" Company during a skirmish with infiltrating Red patrols. The first panel shows a soldier expressing his desire to join the action, lamenting the lack of medals for sniping barbed wire. Another soldier, Pete, responds by holding up a second to warn about an approaching cloud of dust, identifying it as tanks. The urgency escalates as Pete advises Joe to head through the Red flank quickly, warning him of the danger if spotted by the tanks.

In the next panel, Pete instructs Joe to get out of there fast, emphasizing the perilous situation. The scene shifts to a soldier observing an explosion, indicating the presence of enemy tanks. He warns that the Red flank patrol is cutting through their line, and someone is attempting to infiltrate their position. The final panel captures a soldier reacting to an explosion, with the sound effects "RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT" and the exclamation "OHHHHH!" conveying the chaos and intensity of the moment. The setting is a battlefield, with soldiers in combat gear navigating through a landscape marked by explosions and the threat of enemy forces.
