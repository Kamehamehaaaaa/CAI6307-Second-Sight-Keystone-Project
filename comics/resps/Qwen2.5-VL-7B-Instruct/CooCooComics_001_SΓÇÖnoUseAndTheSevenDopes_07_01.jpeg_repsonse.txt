The comic book page opens with a bold title "S'NO USE and THE SEVEN DOPES..." set against a vibrant red background. Below the title, a banner proclaims, "ALL THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS SORDID STORY ARE SUPERFLUOUS AND ENTIRELY MALICIOUS!" This sets a tone of satire and irreverence.

The scene transitions to a grand setting where a king, adorned in regal attire with a crown, stands before a large mirror. He asks, "MIRROR, MIRROR IN MY HAND - WHO'S THE FAIREST IN THE LAND?" The mirror responds, "AH! SO YOU'RE WONDERING TOO!" The king's expression shifts from curiosity to realization as he exclaims, "YOUR STEP-DAUGHTER SNO USE, IS REALLY SOME KID. SHE'S PRETTY LIKE ANYTHING!" 

In the next panel, the king's demeanor changes dramatically. He declares, "I'LL GET RID OF THAT BRAT! NO KID'S GONNA MAKE A MONKEY OUT OF ME!" His frustration is palpable as he gestures emphatically, emphasizing his determination to rid himself of his step-daughter. The interaction between the king and the mirror highlights a classic fairy tale twist, where the king's initial admiration turns into a sinister plot driven by jealousy and fear of being outshone.
