The comic book page opens with a man in a suit and bowler hat running along a beach, shouting "HELP!" in a speech bubble. He appears confused, indicated by the question mark above his head. The scene shifts to him standing on a rock, still calling for help, with the same "HELP!" text. He then has an "IDEA" moment, as indicated by a thought bubble with the word "IDEA." A sign reading "FREE PARKING WALK AND SAVE TIRES" is visible in the background, suggesting he's near a parking area. The man runs back towards the water, exclaiming, "I'LL SAVE YA, LADY!!" in another speech bubble. In the final panel, he is seen working on a car tire, presumably to save someone, as indicated by the previous dialogue. The setting remains consistent throughout the panels, featuring a beach and a parking area with trees in the background.
