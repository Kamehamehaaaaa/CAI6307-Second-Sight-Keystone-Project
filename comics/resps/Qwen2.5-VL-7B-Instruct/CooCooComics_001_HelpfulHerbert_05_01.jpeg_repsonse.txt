The comic book page titled "Helpful Herbert" by Ben Batsford features a series of panels depicting a humorous interaction between Herbert, a man in a blue suit and hat, and a group of beachgoers. The setting is a sunny beach with a clear sky and a few houses visible in the background.

In the first panel, Herbert is walking along a sandy path, thinking aloud, "Mebbe if I take a walk down to th' beach I'll find somebody that needs help— I'm always happy when I'm helpin' somebody." This sets the tone for his helpful nature.

The second panel shows Herbert approaching two women on the beach. One woman, Betty, is sitting on the sand with a small dog, while the other, a young girl, is blowing up a water horse. Herbert offers to help, saying, "Would you like me to help you blow up your water horse, li'l girl?" Betty responds, "Let the nice man help you, Betty."

In the third panel, Herbert is seen blowing into the water horse, but the wind is not strong enough. He exclaims, "It takes a lotta wind t'blow these things up," to which Betty replies, "Yes, it does."

The fourth panel captures the moment when Herbert's吹气使水马膨胀到一个巨大的尺寸，惊讶地喊道，“I think that's big enough.” Betty adds, “Oh---ugh---I've got plenty---ugh---more wind!” 

In the final panel, the water horse has grown so large that it is now a massive creature towering over Herbert and the women. Herbert looks confused and slightly overwhelmed, with question marks above their heads indicating their surprise at the situation.

The comic strip humorously illustrates Herbert's well-intentioned but often misguided attempts to assist others, leading to comical and exaggerated outcomes.
