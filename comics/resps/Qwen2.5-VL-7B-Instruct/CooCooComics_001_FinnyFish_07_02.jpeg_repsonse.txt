The comic book page features a series of interactions between anthropomorphic animal characters, primarily focusing on a green turtle named Finny and his friends. The story begins with Finny lifting a large weight labeled "500," much to the surprise and amusement of his friends, who exclaim, "Haw! Haw! He's gonna try to lift dat real one! Dis is gonna be a riot!" and "Yeah - a riot!"

In the next panel, Finny confidently declares, "Gweat Scott - I weally can lift it! I must be stronger than I thought!" His friends respond with excitement, "Oh, my gosh! He did it! And wit one hand, too!" This moment highlights Finny's newfound strength and the camaraderie among his friends.

The narrative then shifts to Finny being recruited into a secret society by his friends, who say, "Finny, we've decided ta make ya a member of our secret society. All ya hafta do is enter Whalebone Forest and bring us de treasure hidden dere. 'Course we'll let ya keep it for your trouble!" Finny, somewhat apprehensive but intrigued, agrees, "Gwacious! I'm afwaid that it will be pwetty hard to find - but I'll twy!"

The following panels show Finny's journey through the forest, where he encounters Gertie Goldfish, a small yellow character. Gertie expresses concern about Finny's adventure, saying, "I must be careful! If Gertie Goldfish sees me, she'll want to come along, and this is no twip for a girl!" Despite her reservations, Gertie eventually agrees to join Finny, saying, "Either I come along, or no more dates -- and that's of-fish-al!"

The final panel reveals the treasure they have been searching for: a sign that reads, "YOU ARE NOW ENTERTAINING WHALEBONE FOREST ROOKS!" Finny and Gertie look surprised and delighted, with Gertie exclaiming, "OHHHH!" This concludes their adventure, showcasing their teamwork and the unexpected twist in their quest.
