The comic book page opens with a scene of a man swimming in the water, his body partially submerged, suggesting he is either searching for something or someone. The dialogue box above him reads, "AHA, YOU LITTLE GOOD FELLA! WHERE BIG GOOD FELLA? YOU FIX UP LITTLE SON! GET GOOD WELL! ME YOU FRIEND." This indicates that the man is addressing a young boy, possibly his son, who seems to be in need of help.

The next panel shifts to a different setting where a shirtless man sits on a makeshift raft, surrounded by other men. One of them, also shirtless, stands on the raft, holding onto a pole. The dialogue here says, "GOOD, YOU BE MY FRIEND TONIGHT! HELP KILL BAD FELLA! HELP BIG GOOD FELLA...HEY?" This suggests a plot involving a group of men planning an action against a common enemy, with one of them offering friendship and assistance.

The scene then changes to a more intense situation where a man in a striped shirt is being restrained by another man wearing a hat and a brown jacket. The restrained man says, "YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME! I WON'T TALK!" This indicates resistance and a sense of urgency. The dialogue box from the other man reads, "OKAY, BILLOW, WHAT IS THE TREASURE ON THE 'ISLAND QUEEN'? WHERE IS IT?" This reveals that the conversation revolves around finding treasure, specifically the treasure on the "Island Queen."

The final panel shows a group of men, including the restrained man, swimming underwater. The dialogue box reads, "THEY GO LONG BOAT 'SWIFT'...WE SWIM QUIET...MOSTLY UNDERWATER! WE CLIMB ABOARD BIG BOAT, CATCH BAD MAN!" This describes their plan to infiltrate the "Swift" boat and capture the bad men, emphasizing stealth and teamwork.

Overall, the page depicts a narrative filled with tension, cooperation, and a mission to find and retrieve treasure while dealing with adversaries.
