The comic book page opens with Finny, a green turtle character wearing an orange hat and bow tie, advancing backward. Fate intervenes in the guise of a peevish crab, causing Finny to stumble and fall backward into a cactus patch. The scene shifts to Finny landing on a large, green, dinosaur-like creature named Mr. Dwagon, who is knocked out. Finny apologizes, saying, "Forgive me, Mr. Dwagon! I didn't mean to bump you!" The next panel shows Finny's reflection in a puddle, exclaiming, "Good gway! I knocked him out!"

The narrative continues with Finny finding a group of small, yellow creatures hiding behind rocks. Finny reassures them, "You can stop hiding now - you don't have to be afraid - the Dwagon's out cold!" One of the small creatures, Spike, points excitedly, saying, "D-don't l-look now, Spike, but I-I think the critter's wakin' up!" The final panel captures the moment when the large dinosaur-like creature stirs, revealing its eyes opening, much to the surprise of the small creatures.

Throughout the page, the interactions between Finny and the other characters highlight themes of friendship, bravery, and the unexpected turn of events. The setting transitions from a desert landscape with cacti to a more intimate scene by a water puddle, and finally to a rocky area where the small creatures take refuge. The dialogue and expressions convey a sense of camaraderie and relief as Finny helps the small creatures and the large creature awakens.
