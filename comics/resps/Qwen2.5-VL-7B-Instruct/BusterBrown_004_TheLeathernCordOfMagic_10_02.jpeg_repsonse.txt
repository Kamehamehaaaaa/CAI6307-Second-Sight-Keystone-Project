The comic book page opens with a dramatic scene where an eagle, with its powerful talons, is seen in mid-flight, gripping a thong that is tied around the leg of a young boy named Jafara. The setting appears to be a rugged, rocky landscape under a clear sky, suggesting an adventurous or perilous situation. The eagle, with its sharp yellow beak and piercing blue eyes, speaks to Jafara, instructing him to untie the thong from his leg and tie it about his waist. The dialogue box exclaims, "YOU TALK?! THE EAGLE CAN TALK!!" indicating surprise at the bird's ability to communicate.

The narrative then shifts to explain how Jafara's act of kindness almost cost him his life. A broken tree branch caused him to plunge towards the earth, but it was the eagle's talons that saved him. However, this rescue came with a consequence: Jafara received a shock. The text elaborates on the eagle's intervention, stating, "THE EAGLE SPOKE TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A STRANGE COMMAND, BUT JAFARA OBEYED QUICKLY, AND WHEN HE HAD TIED THE LEATHEREN THONG ABOUT THE WAIST OF THE GREAT EAGLE..."

In the next panel, Jafara, now standing confidently with hands on hips, questions the eagle's whereabouts, saying, "B...BUT WHERE IS THE EAGLE?" This moment captures a sense of urgency and confusion. The scene transitions to a darker, more ominous setting where a monstrous figure, possibly a jinn, lies on the ground, appearing injured or defeated. The jinn, with a menacing expression, asks, "WHO TAMPERS WITH MY SORCERY? WHO REMOVED THE CORD OF MAGIC FROM YOUR LEG?" This dialogue suggests a plot involving sorcery and magic, adding layers of mystery and danger to the story. The interaction between the eagle, Jafara, and the jinn forms the core of the narrative, highlighting themes of adventure, magic, and the consequences of good deeds.
