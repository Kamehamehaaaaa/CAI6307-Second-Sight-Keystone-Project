The comic book page opens with a scene of an enemy plane approaching, indicated by the speech bubble saying, "Fine thing! Enemy planes coming and I can't operate this thing!" The setting is a military base, evident from the presence of a large AA gun and sandbags. The next panel shows the AA gun firing, with a dramatic explosion and smoke billowing into the sky.

Transitioning to the second row, a character, presumably Lulu, exclaims, "What a break! With the sarge at that AA gun, I can operate the remote control system and knock those planes down!" She is depicted running towards a control panel, her expression one of determination and urgency. The background includes trees and a distant explosion, suggesting ongoing action.

In the bottom left panel, Lulu is seen inside the control room, looking confused and frustrated. The speech bubble reads, "I saw pictures of this magic brain device, now where is that firing button?" The control panel is detailed with various buttons and switches, emphasizing the complexity of the equipment she's trying to operate.

The final panel on the right shows Lulu outside again, with a man, possibly a soldier, expressing concern. The speech bubble says, "Gulp! Our planes and she's gonna fire the gun! Lulu!" The background features a night sky with silhouettes of planes, adding to the tension. The soldier's expression conveys worry and urgency, highlighting the potential danger of Lulu operating the remote control system without proper training or knowledge.
