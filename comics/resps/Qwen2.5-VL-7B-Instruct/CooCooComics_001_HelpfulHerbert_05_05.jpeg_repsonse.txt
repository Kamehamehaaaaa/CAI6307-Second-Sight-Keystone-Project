The comic book page opens with a muscular man in black shorts standing on a sandy beach, holding a tire. He is speaking to a smaller man dressed in a suit and tie who is kneeling beside him. The setting is a bright, sunny day at the beach, with greenery and water visible in the background.

In the second panel, the muscular man, now identified as "TH' TIRE THIEF," is seen grabbing the smaller man by the collar. The smaller man pleads, "I-I DIDN'T STEAL IT, MISTER!" The muscular man responds harshly, "WELL, YOU LITTLE RUNT~ SO YOU'RE TH' TIRE THIEF!!"

The third panel shows the muscular man continuing his interrogation, saying, "I JUST BORROWED IT~ TO SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE!!" The smaller man, still kneeling, counters with, "H-MMPH! A LIKELY STORY!"

In the fourth panel, the muscular man, now appearing more relaxed, asks, "SO YA BORROWED MY TIRE TO SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE~ HEY!!?" The smaller man nods, saying, "Y-YES SIR!"

The final panel captures a dramatic moment where the muscular man, still holding the tire, exclaims, "WELL~ NOW BORROW ANOTHER ONE 'SAVE YER OWN!!!‚Äù The smaller man is then seen being thrown into the water, creating a large splash. The muscular man stands triumphantly, having successfully made his point.
