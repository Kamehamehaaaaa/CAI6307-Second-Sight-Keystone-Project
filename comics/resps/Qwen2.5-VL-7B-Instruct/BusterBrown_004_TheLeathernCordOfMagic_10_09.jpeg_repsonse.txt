The comic book page depicts a dramatic confrontation between two characters, each armed with a blade, set against the backdrop of a mystical and tense scene. The dialogue reveals that one character, identified as "My Father," is rising, while another, referred to as "The Wazir," draws his own blade. The setting appears to be a room adorned with blue curtains, suggesting an indoor location, possibly a palace or a chamber of significance.

In the first panel, the character with the blade speaks to their companion, urging them to stand aside, indicating a sense of urgency and danger. The second panel shows the same character addressing a sorcerer, challenging him with a declaration of power and magic, hinting at a battle of wits and strength. The sorcerer, in turn, responds with a boast of his magical abilities, calling upon spirits and forces from the world of shade, adding a layer of supernatural intrigue to the conflict.

The narrative continues with the arrival of "the evil forces" at the call of "Bele Kahr," who has gained their support. This development intensifies the stakes of the confrontation. In the final panel, the focus shifts to a group of characters, including "Jafara" and "Karim," who are visibly distressed. Karim's condition is critical; he is weakening badly, and the leather cord around his waist is slipping, suggesting a physical struggle or a magical bind. Jafara pleads for Karim to stay back, expressing his own fear and desperation, as the situation seems to be spiraling out of control. The chaotic scene is further emphasized by the swirling clouds and the expressions of panic on the characters' faces, creating a vivid depiction of a high-stakes moment in the story.
