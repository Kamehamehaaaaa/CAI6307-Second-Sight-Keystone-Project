The comic book page opens with a dialogue between a man in a blue robe and two women, one with red hair and the other with blue hair, both dressed in traditional attire. The man, who appears to be a king or ruler, is lying on a bed draped in purple fabric, while the women stand beside him. The woman with red hair asks, "YOU?! HOW DID YOU ESCAPE THE ENCHANTMENT, AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?" The man responds, "ONLY WITH THE HELP OF ALLAH, TO SAVE YOU FROM BELE KAHIR, YOUR SORCERER! ONLY NOW HAVE WE LIFTED THE SPELL..." The woman with blue hair interjects, "YOU LIE! THIS IS A TRICK TO WIN MY DAUGHTER!" The man replies, "IT IS TRUE, FATHER! I COOKED THE FISH AND FEED THEM TO YOU MYSELF! I SAW THE SPELL LIFT."

The scene shifts to another part of the room where the man, now sitting up, continues his conversation with the woman with blue hair. He says, "PLEASE, SIRE, WE ASK ONLY THAT YOU RECLINE ONCE MORE UPON YOUR COUCH AND FEIGN UNCONSCIOUSNESS! THEN WATCH WHAT YOUR WAZIR DOES!" The woman responds, "DO NOT FEAR, SIRE...WE WILL BE NEAR..." The man then turns to the woman with red hair and adds, "IT IS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THIS, BUT I WILL DO AS YOU SAY..."

In the final panel, the man is shown lying back down on the bed, appearing unconscious. The woman with blue hair stands beside him, and the woman with red hair is seen outside the room, holding a staff. The man's wazir, dressed in green, is also present, standing near the bed. The wazir declares, "AH...THE MIGHTY ONE IS STILL HELD BY THE SPELL! ONE MORE POTION, AND THERE WILL BE A NEW CALIPH IN BAGHDAD TOMORROW, AND IT WILL BE MYSELF!"

The setting is a richly decorated room with vibrant colors, including purple, yellow, and red, suggesting a royal palace. The interaction between the characters revolves around a complex plot involving enchantment, sorcery, and political maneuvering, with the central figure, the king, being the focal point of their discussion.
