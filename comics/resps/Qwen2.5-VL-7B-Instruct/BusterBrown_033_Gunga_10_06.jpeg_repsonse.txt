The comic book page depicts a scene set in a lush jungle environment, where three men are engaged in securing an elephant. The first panel shows one man tying the tusker well, while another expresses concern about the elephant following them if it is loose. The dialogue reveals their intent to keep the elephant at bay for safety reasons.

In the second panel, the focus shifts to the ground where the men are digging or searching for something amidst the dense foliage. One man speaks of not seeing Padman, indicating she might be nearby but obscured by the elephants' proximity. Another man warns Gunga to be careful, suggesting they are on a mission that requires vigilance.

The final panel captures a moment of preparation as one man instructs Gunga to feed the rope carefully to him, emphasizing the need to avoid entanglement. He also hints at the possibility of needing to move quickly due to the presence of an elephant. The dialogue concludes with a hopeful prayer, "May the gods be kind to you, Gunga," showing the men's reliance on divine intervention for their safety and success. The setting remains consistently within the jungle, with the men dressed in simple attire suitable for their outdoor task.
