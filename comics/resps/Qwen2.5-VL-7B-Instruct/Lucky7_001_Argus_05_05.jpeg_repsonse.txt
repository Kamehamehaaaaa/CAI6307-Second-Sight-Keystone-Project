The comic book page opens with a tense confrontation between two men. The first panel shows one man, identified by the speech bubble as "Carl," grabbing another man's arm, who responds with, "NOT SO FAST, CARL. I'M NOT AN OLD MAN!" This sets the stage for a dramatic scene. In the second panel, Carl is seen swinging a knife, which is met with a sharp "CRACK" as he strikes the other man, indicating a physical altercation.

The narrative progresses to the third panel where Carl is depicted in a crouched position, holding the knife, with the speech bubble exclaiming, "WOULDN'T HE LIKE TO GET THESE --- INSTEAD HE'S GONNA GET THIS!" This suggests that Carl has discovered something valuable or significant on the floor. The fourth panel introduces an inspector, Dykes, who enters the scene, brandishing a gun and demanding, "DROP THAT KNIFE, CARL!" This indicates that Carl is now under arrest.

In the fifth panel, we see Inspector Dykes, now behind bars, as he calls on Argus, Inc., a detective agency. The sixth panel provides context: the old man owned the house, and Carl brought him food. Carl found out about the money and killed the recluse when Dykes interrupted him. The body was stuffed into the closet. Dykes thanks Nick for their help in catching the murderer and wishes Nick well for his next problem. The final panel shows a group of men, including Nick, gathered around a table, discussing the case, with one man pointing towards the others, emphasizing the resolution of the crime.
