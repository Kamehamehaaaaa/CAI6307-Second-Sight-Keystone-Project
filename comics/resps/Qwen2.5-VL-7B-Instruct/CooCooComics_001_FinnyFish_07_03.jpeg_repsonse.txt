The comic book page opens with a scene of two anthropomorphic characters, Finny and Spike, expressing concern about their journey. Finny, with a worried expression, says, "I feel a little shaky, Finny! Er... maybe we shouldn't go any further!" Spike, more confident, replies, "Awight! Turn back if you're afraid! I'm going on!" The setting is a cave entrance with a sign that ominously reads, "If you wish to remain alive TURN BACK." This sets a tense atmosphere.

As they proceed, the characters encounter a large, menacing sea-dragon. Finny exclaims, "Gulp! Look!" while Spike, looking back, says, "Run, Finny! There's a great big sea-dragon chasin' us!" The sea-dragon, depicted with exaggerated features and a threatening posture, adds to the fear. However, another character, Johnny, appears, calling out, "Hiya, fellas, what's up?" This moment introduces a sense of relief and camaraderie.

The narrative takes an unexpected turn when Johnny reveals that there’s no such thing as a dwagon (a play on "dragon"). The sea-dragon, now revealed to be a mere creature of imagination, is shown to be nothing more than a pile of bones and a few bones scattered around. The sea-dragon, realizing its mistake, asks, "Who's afraid of dwagons—besides me?" This humorous twist brings a light-hearted conclusion to the page, emphasizing the absurdity of the initial fear. The interaction between the characters, from initial apprehension to the realization of the situation, creates a dynamic and engaging story.
