The comic book page opens with a vibrant scene where a character named Karim is seen in a dynamic pose, surrounded by swirling clouds of energy. A speech bubble exclaims, "There, Karim... your power has returned! Call upon the cord!" This suggests that Karim's powers have been restored, possibly through a ritual or a magical act involving the "cord."
