The comic book page opens with a scene of urgency and action. A man in a yellow shirt is seen pushing another man in a green striped shirt, who is struggling against him. The text above reads, "And when the two were through..." The next panel shows the man in the yellow shirt helping an elderly man on the ground, saying, "Quick, Kala, go over to the road and stop a car! This old man is hurt bad!" Another man in a blue shirt and shorts is running towards them, exclaiming, "Me go plenty quick!"

The scene then shifts to a hospital setting where Captain Mooney, identified as the captain of the "Island Queen," lies in bed. He speaks to a young man named Beau Dillon, who is identified as an island pirate and the worst crook in the South Pacific. Captain Mooney reveals that Dillon's men attacked him earlier, and he wants to find out what his treasure was. The treasure, he explains, is not gold, silver, or pearls but something more valuable. The text box reads, "I'm Captain Mooney, of the 'Island Queen', now lyin' in fifteen fathoms o' water in th' cove of Bandara Island. Dillon's men were the ones who jumped me tonight."

In the next panel, Captain Mooney continues, "And he wanted t'find out what my treasure was. 'Tis aboard my ship, the 'Island Queen.' He sunk me at Bandara, but he doesn't know what it is. It's not gold, or silver, or pearls..." The text box adds, "The old captain's head dropped back, and he went to his last port of call..."

The final panel shows a beach scene with a ship docked near the shore. Two men stand on the beach, one holding a map, while a child looks on. The text reads, "We really gonna try get Captain Mooney's treasure." Below, another man says, "Might's well, Kala! Captain didn't have a relative, and the law of salvage permits us to---" The page number "2" is visible in the bottom right corner.

This sequence of panels depicts a narrative filled with tension, mystery, and adventure, centered around the search for Captain Mooney's treasure and the actions of the characters involved.
