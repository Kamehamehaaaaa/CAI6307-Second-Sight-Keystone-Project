The comic book page opens with a scene where a young lamb, dressed in a yellow outfit with red accents, is being scolded by an older character, presumably her father, who is wearing a blue hat and a red bow tie. The father sternly tells the lamb, "LESTER YOU MUST PROMISE TO BEHAVE FROM NOW ON!" The setting appears to be a farmyard, with a wooden fence and a tractor in the background.

In the next panel, the lamb, now identified as Lester, is seen running away from a large cannon that has been set up on the farm. The cannon is pointed towards the lamb, and the lamb looks terrified, with its hands raised in a gesture of surrender. The text bubble reads, "LESTER! I DIDN'T MEAN......!"

The following panel shows Lester, now in a more reflective mood, sitting alone under a tree. She is wearing a red hat and a yellow dress, and she is visibly upset. Her thoughts are captured in a speech bubble: "I CAN'T BEAR TO LOOK 'SNIFF': HE WAS SUCH A NICE LAMB 'SNIFF': EVEN IF HE WAS A NUISANCE!"

In the fourth panel, Lester is seen walking away from the cannon, which is now firing, and she encounters a white dog. The dog, who seems to have been involved in the cannon's operation, is playfully interacting with Lester. The text bubble says, "NOT A BAD PRESSING JOB, EH?"

The fifth panel captures Lester's reaction to the cannon's explosion, which has left a large hole in the ground. She is standing near the crater, looking at the damage with a mix of shock and sadness. The text reads, "IT WAS POSITIVELY SHAMEFUL OF YOU TO SCARE ME LIKE THAT."

Finally, in the last panel, Lester is seen walking towards a man dressed in a suit and top hat, who is identified as "DADDY'S BANKER, MR. HAVCASH." The lamb is talking to the banker, saying, "OH! THERE'S DADDY'S BANKER, MR. HAVCASH." The banker responds, "OH, OH...THAT GUY CAN TALK FOR HOURS!" This interaction suggests a shift in the lamb's focus from the cannon incident to engaging with the banker.
