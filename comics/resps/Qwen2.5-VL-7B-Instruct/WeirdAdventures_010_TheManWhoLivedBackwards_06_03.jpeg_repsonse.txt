The comic book page opens with a character, David, facing another individual who is holding a glass of what appears to be champagne. The dialogue reveals David's distress as he pleads for help, his words distorted by the backward time he's experiencing. The setting transitions to a bar where David is seen again, this time with a bartender pouring a drink into a glass. The environment here is dimly lit, suggesting an evening atmosphere.

The narrative shifts to a street scene where David is outside, looking distressed, with a car parked nearby. The next panel shows David in a state of despair, his face contorted in agony, as he questions the nature of his backward time travel. The following scene depicts him in bed, visibly upset, contemplating the implications of his condition. 

In the final panels, David is shown in a room, sitting at a desk, with a lamp casting light on his face. He is deep in thought, trying to remember events from the day forward, specifically focusing on Peggy and their engagement. The page concludes with David's realization that he might lose his mind if he can't recall future events, highlighting his growing panic and confusion about his situation.
