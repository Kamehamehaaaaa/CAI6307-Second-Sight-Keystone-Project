The comic book page features a humorous interaction between two anthropomorphic bears and a goat on a snowy cliffside. The first panel shows one bear, wearing a red jacket with "POP" written on the back, calling out "YOO-HOO, POP!" to another bear who is perched higher up on the cliff. The second bear responds with "OH MY GOODNESS ---- THEY CLIMBED THE CLIFF!" indicating surprise at the other bear's daring climb.

In the third panel, the bear at the bottom of the cliff exclaims, "I HOPE THIS W-WORKS!" while holding what appears to be a makeshift weapon or tool, possibly a stick or branch, which he seems to have fashioned for the occasion. This suggests he is preparing to use it for some purpose, likely related to the situation with the goat.

The fourth panel reveals that the bear has indeed used his improvised tool to confront the goat, who is standing on the cliff. The bear, now in a more aggressive stance, declares "HMMMM! TRESPASSER!" The goat, looking surprised and slightly alarmed, stands its ground.

In the fifth panel, the bear, now sitting on the ground, breathes heavily and says "WHHEW!" indicating relief or exhaustion after the confrontation. The goat, still on the cliff, looks on with a mix of curiosity and apprehension.

The final panel captures the aftermath of the bear's action. The bear, having presumably thrown or pushed something towards the goat, is shown falling off the cliff with a dramatic "EEE-YOW!" The goat, reacting to the impact, is depicted with a "WHUMP!" sound effect, suggesting a loud thud upon landing. The bear's final exclamation, "GARR-RGH!" adds to the comedic effect, emphasizing the bear's exaggerated reaction to the fall.

The setting throughout the panels is a snowy, mountainous landscape, providing a picturesque backdrop to the unfolding comedy. The interaction between the characters is filled with humor and exaggerated expressions, typical of classic comic book storytelling.
