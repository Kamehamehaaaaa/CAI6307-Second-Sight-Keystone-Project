The comic book page opens with a scene where a character in green, presumably a king, is instructing another character in orange, who appears to be a knight or soldier, to take "Sno Use" for a long walk, emphasizing that she is not to return. The dialogue box reads: "I want you to take Sno Use for a nice long walk - and she's not to return... UNDERSTAND?" The knight responds with a firm "Yes, Your Majesty." The setting transitions to an outdoor environment where the knight, now wearing a hat and boots, is seen walking with a woman dressed in red, who seems to be "Sno Use," as indicated by her name tag. The knight encourages her with, "Come on, S'No Use. Put on your feet! We're going for a walk in the country." The woman, however, expresses hopefulness with, "Oh 'Goody! Maybe I'll meet a prince charming or something."

The narrative continues with the knight and "Sno Use" walking through a scenic landscape. The knight stops to smell a flower, exclaiming, "Oooh! Wot a lovely flower!" while "Sno Use" looks on with a hopeful expression, saying, "Here's my chance!" Suddenly, the knight panics, shouting, "It's no use... I can't do it," as he falls into a muddy puddle.

In the next panel, the knight is seen sneaking away, planning to leave "Sno Use" behind, fearing she might get lost or fall off a cliff or be eaten by a bear or struck by lightning. The final panel shows "Sno Use" discovering she is lost, standing at a crossroads with signs pointing in various directions, including "One Way to Los Angeles," "This Way to Buenos Aires," and "To Polo Grounds." She cries out, "Help! I'm lost," highlighting the comedic and chaotic nature of the situation.
