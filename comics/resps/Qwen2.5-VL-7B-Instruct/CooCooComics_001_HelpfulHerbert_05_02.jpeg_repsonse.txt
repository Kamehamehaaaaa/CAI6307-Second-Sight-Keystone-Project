The comic book page opens with a large, orange, inflated water horse floating on the beach, drawing attention from several onlookers. The first panel shows a group of people, including a man in a suit and two children, observing the water horse with curiosity. In the second panel, the water horse is now closer to the shore, and the man in the suit appears to be interacting with one of the children, who seems to be pointing at the water horse.

Suddenly, the water horse explodes, sending debris flying into the air. The word "BANG!" is prominently displayed in bold letters, emphasizing the explosion. The next panel captures the aftermath of the explosion, with the man in the suit and the children reacting to the chaos. The woman, wearing an orange swimsuit, is seen yelling, "Now see what you've done—YOU BRUTE!" while the child exclaims, "I'LL BUY HER ANOTHER WATER HORSE." The man responds with a dismissive "BAH! I WANT MY WATTA HORSE!"

In the following panel, the woman continues her tirade, saying, "HOW WILL YOU BUY A NEW RUBBER WATER-HORSE?—DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON?—OR ARE YOU MISTER PRIORITY?!" The man, still in his suit, looks frustrated and exclaims, "BAH!" The final panel shows the man walking away dejectedly, with the woman and child watching him go. The man turns back and says, "GOSH! SOME PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU TRY T'DO 'EM A FAVOR!!" The scene concludes with the man walking off the beach, leaving the woman and child behind, seemingly unresolved by the situation.
