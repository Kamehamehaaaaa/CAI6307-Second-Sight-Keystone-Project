The comic book page opens with a wizard-like character in a green top hat and coat, addressing a group of animals. He says, "Say, I represent the Blowyournose Handkerchief Co.! Can you make me 3,000,000 dozen?" The animals, including a lion and a rabbit, look skeptical, with one rabbit exclaiming, "Don't be so silly! There aren't that many noses!" 

In the next panel, the lion, now wearing a party hat, sneezes uncontrollably, saying, "Aachoo! I can't stop sneezing! It's those flowered handkerchiefs I'm allergic to them! My hay fever!" The wizard, now in a more animated pose, responds, "I'll give all the money I have to you! Just make those handkerchiefs disappear!"

The scene shifts to a stage where the wizard, still in his party hat, announces, "Now, ladies and gents, I'm going to saw Miss Catsup into two equal parts! Come out—Miss Catsup!" The audience, consisting of various animals, looks on with anticipation.

In the final panel, the wizard is seen holding a saw, and the caption reads, "Miss Catsup has been sawed in half so many times she looks like a pair of bookends!" The wizard then turns to an audience member, saying, "Madam, would you please—" but the rest of the sentence is cut off, leaving the audience member's response unknown.
