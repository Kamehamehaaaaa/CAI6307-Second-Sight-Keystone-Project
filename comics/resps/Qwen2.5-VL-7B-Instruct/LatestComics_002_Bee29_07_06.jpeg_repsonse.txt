The comic book page opens with a scene of chaos where a bee is seen flying away from a large yellow object, possibly a beehive, with the word "GLUB!" indicating its escape. The next panel shows two bees, one with a concerned expression, exclaiming, "WHAT TH... ONE OF 'EM GOT AWAY!" The following panel introduces a character dressed in a superhero costume, complete with a cape and mask, who declares, "I'VE GOT TO STOP HIM! HE'S A MENACE TO PUBLIC HEALTH!" This character is seen running through the clouds, determined to catch the escaping bee.

In the subsequent panels, the bee, now identified as the "chieftain," is pursued by the superhero. The bee, with a mischievous grin, taunts, "IF YOU STING ME YOU GOSH!... THAT IS GET MORTAL GERM AND DIE!" The superhero, undeterred, continues his pursuit. The final panels show the bee approaching Farmer Gray's farm, with the caption, "OH-OH! HE'S HEADING FOR FARMER GRAY'S!" The last panel captures Farmer Gray, seated at a desk, contemplating the situation with a thoughtful expression, while the bee hovers nearby, ready to deliver its "kiss of death." The dialogue concludes with the bee confidently stating, "THIS IS GONNA HURT FARMER GRAY, BUT IT'S GOTTA BE DONE!" The overall tone of the page is humorous and action-packed, with the bee's antics providing the main source of comedy.
