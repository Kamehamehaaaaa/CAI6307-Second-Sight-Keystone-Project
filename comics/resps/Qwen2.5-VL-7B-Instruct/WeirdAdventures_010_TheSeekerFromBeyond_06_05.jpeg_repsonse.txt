The comic book page opens with a man and a woman seated on a bench under a night sky, the man speaking earnestly about something fantastic that upsets him. The woman, Jane, listens intently, her expression a mix of curiosity and concern. The dialogue reveals the man's struggle to convey his message, emphasizing its importance and the emotional turmoil it causes.

In the next panel, the man leans closer, his voice filled with urgency, as he tells Jane about a mysterious figure they encountered earlier. The woman, now standing, turns to face them, her eyes wide with surprise and fear. The man's tone shifts to one of alarm as he realizes she is staring at them, his words punctuated by the word "Suddenly..." indicating an unexpected turn of events.

The tension escalates as the woman, now in a red dress, confronts the man directly, her hand raised as if to strike. The man, still seated, looks shocked and distressed, his mouth open in a silent plea for help. The woman's expression is fierce, her eyes reflecting a mix of anger and determination.

In the final panels, the man pleads with the woman to stop, his hands bound behind his back, while the woman, now fully engaged in the confrontation, declares her willingness to go to another world to free him. The man, John Grant, agrees, his voice resigned yet hopeful. The scene captures a moment of high drama, where the characters' emotions and actions drive the narrative forward, leaving the reader eager to see what happens next.
