The comic book page opens with the title "G.I. Joe in Medal for Willie" prominently displayed at the top left corner. The setting is a military camp, indicated by the tents and soldiers in uniform. The narrative begins with a group of soldiers, including Hendricks, Henshaw, Jakowsky, and Lawton, gathered around a central figure who is holding a letter. The soldier in the foreground, wearing a helmet and a jacket, appears to be reading the letter intently.

The dialogue reveals that the battalion postmaster's jeep has arrived, bringing mail from home. The excitement is palpable as the soldiers react with whooping and hollering. Private Pete Cirillo receives a letter from his wife, complete with snapshots, while Sergeant Mulvaney gets a Philadelphia department store circular. However, among all the mail, Pete is particularly happy, as indicated by the caption: "But of all the guys, Pete was the happiest..."

The scene shifts to show two soldiers, one of whom is holding a letter and the other is looking at a photograph. The soldier with the letter says, "Mary says here... William is getting bigger every day, always asks me when Daddy is coming home, and I wonder and pray, too, darling..." The other soldier responds, "Gee, he sure is a good-looking kid, Pete! How old is he?" The conversation continues with the first soldier noting, "Oh, little Willie is goin' on six years old already! He ain't no baby any more! Yeah, end of this month he'll be six!"

The page concludes with a close-up of the photograph showing a young boy with a joyful expression, reinforcing the theme of family and the emotional connection between the soldiers and their loved ones back home. The overall tone of the page is one of camaraderie and the shared joy of receiving letters and photographs from home during wartime.
