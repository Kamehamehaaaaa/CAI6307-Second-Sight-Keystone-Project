The comic book page opens with a soldier in a green uniform, holding a cup, exclaiming "What hit me?" as he is enveloped by a cloud of smoke and stars, suggesting a sudden impact or surprise. The scene shifts to another soldier, also in green, asking the first one, "Any mail for me, Sarge?" The first soldier, now standing, responds with a playful tone, "Yeah, Private and say PLEASE!" 

In the next panel, the first soldier, now kneeling, excitedly exclaims, "Oh, boy! A package! Wonder what it is?" He hands over a wrapped item to the second soldier, who eagerly takes it. The first soldier then exclaims, "Cake!!" as the second soldier, now lying on the ground, looks surprised and delighted.

The scene changes to show the first soldier, now standing, shouting, "Cake! Come and get it! Yippie....we eat!" as other soldiers rush towards him. The second soldier, still on the ground, calls out, "Wait a minute, fellas...it's only a cake o' soap!" The final panel shows the second soldier, now sitting up, laughing heartily while the first soldier looks confused and slightly amused. The text concludes with the second soldier saying, "But look what came with it!!"

The comic captures a humorous misunderstanding involving a package that turns out to be a bar of soap, adding a layer of slapstick comedy typical of wartime humor.
