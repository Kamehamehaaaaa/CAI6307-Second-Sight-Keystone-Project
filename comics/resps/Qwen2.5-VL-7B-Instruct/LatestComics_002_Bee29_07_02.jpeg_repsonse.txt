The comic book page opens with a scene where a character, identified by the speech bubble as "A SPY!" is being pursued by a bee-like figure. The spy is crouched behind bushes, holding a device that emits a signal, indicated by the radio waves depicted above his head. The bee-like figure, wearing a blue cape and red shoes, is in hot pursuit, flying low over the bushes.
