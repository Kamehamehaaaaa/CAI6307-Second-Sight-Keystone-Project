The comic book page opens with a scene set in a military field, where two soldiers are inspecting the latest army equipment. One soldier excitedly exclaims, "We got all the latest army equipment at this field! Stuff the enemy would love to get their hands on!" The other responds, "Really?" The setting is vibrant with green grass and trees, suggesting an outdoor environment.

In the next panel, one of the soldiers points towards a large, cylindrical device, saying, "That's why I'm here, brother! This way! I'll show ya our newest sound detector!" The device appears to be a sophisticated piece of equipment, possibly a radar or early warning system, mounted on wheels for mobility.

The narrative continues with a close-up of the sound detector, which has large, circular "ears" that can detect sounds from planes up to 100 miles away. The soldier enthusiastically declares, "These 'ears' can pick up the sound o' planes 100 miles away!" Another soldier adds, "The emperor will love this shot!" The excitement is palpable as they anticipate the device's capabilities.

Suddenly, the scene shifts dramatically. A woman, presumably a civilian, enters the frame, looking alarmed. She shouts, "It's an enemy raid! Outa my way let me at that Ack-Ack gun!" The urgency in her voice suggests a critical situation. The soldiers react quickly, with one soldier exclaiming, "Oh, oh! How does this new A.A. gadget work??"

The final panel shows the woman running towards an anti-aircraft gun, while the soldiers look on, seemingly overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events. The chaotic energy of the scene is captured through the dynamic expressions and the urgent dialogue, highlighting the unexpected nature of the enemy raid and the soldiers' struggle to respond effectively.
