The comic book page opens with a young mahout, a character dressed in traditional attire, fearlessly navigating through a grazing herd of elephants in a lush, sunlit forest. The text at the top reads, "FEARLESSLY THE YOUNG MAHOUT WORKS HIS WAY UNNOTICED THROUGH THE GRAZING HERD SEEKING THE RUNAWAY COW ELEPHANT." The mahout's journey is depicted in three panels: he is seen from behind, moving stealthily among the elephants, then crouching near one, and finally, in another panel, he is positioned beneath an elephant, suggesting he has found his target.

In the next sequence, the mahout, now identified as Padmah, is shown kneeling beside a large elephant, which is labeled as "PADMAH!" The text indicates that Padmah has been found. The setting shifts slightly, showing Padmah in a different part of the forest, still in close proximity to the elephant, emphasizing the successful reunion.

The narrative progresses as Gunga, another mahout, quickly secures the Keddah hook onto the elephant's leg with practiced hands. The text reads, "GUNGA QUICKLY FASTENS THE KEDDAH HOOK WITH PRACTICED HANDS..." This panel captures the precise moment of action, highlighting Gunga's skill and urgency.

Finally, the last panel shows Padmah, now captured, being led away by the elephant. The text concludes with "...AND PADMAH IS CAPTURED!" The mahout is depicted running alongside the elephant, which is pulling him along, indicating the end of Padmah's escape attempt and the beginning of his captivity.

Throughout the page, the interactions between the mahouts and the elephants are central, showcasing their roles and the challenges they face in managing these majestic creatures. The vibrant colors and detailed illustrations bring the forest setting to life, enhancing the dramatic tension of the story.
