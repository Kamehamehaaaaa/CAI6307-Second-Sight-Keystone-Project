The comic book page opens with a scene inside Captain King's field shack, where a conversation unfolds between two soldiers. The first soldier, holding a medal, expresses his frustration about the war's end and the injustice of not receiving a Bronze Star for his actions. He emphasizes that if he hadn't delayed the enemy tanks, they would have hit their line while he was still out cold. The second soldier, who is also a recipient of the Bronze Star, defends Pete's bravery, stating that he deserves the medal more than anyone else.

The narrative then shifts to a hospital setting where a soldier, lying on a cot, receives the news that he has been awarded the Bronze Star. His friends express their pride and joy, imagining how proud his family will be. The soldier, overwhelmed by the news, decides to rest now, indicating the physical toll of the war.

In another panel, a soldier is seen discussing the award with his friends, revealing that he had solved a problem for Susie, who is getting a Bronze Star as a birthday present. This revelation leads to a humorous exchange where one friend questions what a guy like him would do without medals, suggesting that medals are reserved for heroes.

The final panel shows a soldier walking away, pondering the nature of heroism, while a sergeant, depicted in a close-up, reflects on the complexities of the situation. The page concludes with the caption "The End," leaving the reader to ponder the true meaning of heroism and recognition in wartime.
