The comic book page opens with a scene inside a cozy cabin where a young girl, dressed in a red dress, is serving breakfast to seven dwarfs who are seated around a wooden table. The girl exclaims, "Breakfast is ready!" while the dwarfs respond with complaints about the quality of their meals, particularly the burnt toast and the bad coffee. One dwarf says, "She sure makes rotten coffee," while another adds, "I'm still sick from yesterday's meals." The dialogue suggests that the dwarfs are frustrated with the girl’s cooking skills.

The scene transitions to an outdoor setting where one of the dwarfs, holding a piece of paper, announces, "I want to insert this ad in your morning gossip!" He then proceeds to read aloud: "WANTED - A PRINCE CHARMING FOR S'NO USE! SHE IS AT THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN DOPES... APPLY AT ONCE -- NO REFERENCES NEEDED, EVEN..." This ad is clearly meant to be humorous, as it implies that the girl, referred to as "S'no Use," is looking for a prince charming despite her current situation.

In the next panel, a blue jay perched on a tree branch is seen holding a piece of paper that reads, "B.BLUE-JAY ALL THE GOSSIP - ALL TH' TIME!" The jay seems to be a gossip bird, adding to the comedic tone of the story.

The final two panels show a man dressed as Robin Hood, sitting on a horse, reading the same wanted ad. He responds to the jay by saying, "HM - AN AD! SHOULD WE INQUIRE?" The jay replies, "I'LL TOSS YOU FER IT." In the last panel, Robin Hood tosses the jay, and the bird falls to the ground, with the caption, "OKAY - YOU TOSSED ME FOR IT! NOW LET'S INQUIRE." This sequence humorously depicts the dwarfs’ attempts to find a prince charming for the girl, with the jay and Robin Hood adding to the comedic chaos.
