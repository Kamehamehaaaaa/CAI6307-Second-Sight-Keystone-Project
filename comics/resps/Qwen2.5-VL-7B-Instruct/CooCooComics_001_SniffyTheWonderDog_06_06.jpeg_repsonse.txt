The second panel shows Benny standing up, looking at the dog with a mix of surprise and amusement. He exclaims, "Da Mazuma! What a pooch!!" The dog seems to be playfully jumping towards him, adding to the comedic tone.

In the third panel, Benny is now holding a bag and talking to the dog, saying, "I don't wantcha to think Benny da Boiglar is ungrateful! Ask me any favor ya want, pooch!" The dog looks up expectantly, ready for a command.

The fourth panel continues the interaction with Benny handing over the bag to the dog, saying, "Okay, pal... here's da bag! See me to da door!" The dog eagerly takes the bag and walks away, while Benny prepares to leave.

In the fifth panel, Benny is seen picking up some tools, saying, "Now I'll just pick up me tools an'--" before being interrupted by the dog, which is now carrying the bag and looking back at Benny with a determined expression.

The sixth panel captures a moment of surprise and action. The dog, now carrying the bag, is seen in mid-stride, and Benny is falling backward, exclaiming, "What the...! Oooof!" The dog continues to walk away, leaving Benny on the ground.

The final panel focuses on the dog's face, showing a satisfied expression with the word "Arf!" indicating its contentment with the task.
