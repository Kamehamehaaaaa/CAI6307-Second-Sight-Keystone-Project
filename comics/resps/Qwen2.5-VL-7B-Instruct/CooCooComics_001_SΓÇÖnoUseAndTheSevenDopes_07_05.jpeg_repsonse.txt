The comic book page opens with the Jealous Queen, dressed in green robes and adorned with a crown, sitting on a throne-like chair. She is visibly upset, exclaiming, "I gotta get rid of that brat..." The setting appears to be her palace, indicated by the ornate furniture and the window behind her. A sign on the wall reads, "FLASH! SNO USE NOW AT THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN CRACK-POTS UN-FLASH," hinting at a place where someone named Sno Use might be located.

In the next panel, the Queen is seen holding a book titled "BLACK MAGIC: HOW TO CHANGE INTO A THING!" with a mischievous grin, suggesting she plans to use dark magic to transform herself into something beautiful. The background features a glowing light bulb, adding an eerie atmosphere to the scene.

The narrative shifts to the Queen, now transformed into a more attractive version of herself, as indicated by the speech bubble saying, "I'M GORGEOUS!" She admires herself in a mirror, which reflects her new appearance, and exclaims, "BEH!" with excitement. This transformation seems to have been successful, as she is now confident and pleased with her new look.

The final panels show the Queen, still in her green robes and crown, instructing a vulture to take her to the House of the Seven Idiots. The vulture, labeled "FOR HIRE 20Â¢ FIRST MILE," agrees to the task. In the last frame, the Queen is seen walking towards the house, with the vulture following closely behind. The Queen's dialogue here is, "THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH! I'LL WALK THE REST OF THE WAY," indicating her determination to reach her destination despite the vulture's offer to assist her. The setting here is outdoors, with a sign reading "TO THE OCCASIONS" visible in the background, adding a whimsical touch to the scene.
