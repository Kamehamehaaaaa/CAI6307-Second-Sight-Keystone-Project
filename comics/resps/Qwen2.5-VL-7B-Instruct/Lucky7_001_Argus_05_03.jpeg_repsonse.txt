The comic book page opens with a scene inside a bank where a man in a green suit is being confronted by another man in a brown suit. The man in the green suit exclaims, "We better hand this over to Dykes. He thinks we did it. One of his men is downstairs watching us." The man in the brown suit responds, "Oh, no! We'll solve this case ourselves. What publicity! I'll call Fred at the bank."

The next panel shows a close-up of the man in the brown suit on the phone, saying, "You'll call me if anybody tries to withdraw the account. I'll have Al watch your bank. Thanks, Fred."

The scene shifts to the man in the brown suit being arrested outside the Industrial Bank. He is being led away by two men in suits, one of whom says, "Hello, Al! I knew you'd come sooner or later. You're under arrest." The other man adds, "But--but--you are making a big mistake!"

The following panel depicts a family scene where a woman is talking to her son, Peter, who is reading a book. She says, "Mom says you can stay with us 'til you solve your problem. Can I help, Nick?" Peter replies, "Thanks, Peter. I won't be here long."

The final panels show Nick sneaking into the miser's home to question Carl, the janitor. Nick asks, "At night, Nick sneaks over to the miser's home to question Carl, the janitor. No one ever visited the old geezer? Who brought him his food, Carl?" Carl responds, "An old crony of his came twice a week with grub. Didn't show up today, though."

In the last scene, Nick is talking to Carl, who says, "Maybe the old miser's friend did it and skipped, Nick?" Nick reflects, "Several days have passed. Possible, but how come no one ever saw him except Carl?"
