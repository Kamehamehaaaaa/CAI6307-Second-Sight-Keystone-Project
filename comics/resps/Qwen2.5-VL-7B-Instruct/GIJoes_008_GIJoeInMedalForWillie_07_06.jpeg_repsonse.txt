The comic book page depicts a dramatic scene of a soldier named Pete attempting to stop an advancing tank force. The first panel shows Pete, with one grenade left, running towards the tanks, exclaiming, "I got one grenade left! Maybe I can... OHHHH! MY LEGS!" The second panel captures the moment as Pete dives to the ground, with the sound effect "RUMMMBBLLLE" indicating the approaching tank. In the third panel, the tank is shown rolling over Pete, with the sound effect "WHEEEEEEE BLAAMM!" emphasizing the impact. The fourth panel reveals the aftermath, with Pete lying motionless amidst the chaos, and the sound effect "BLAAAMM!" reinforcing the destruction.

The narrative continues with Pete's condition being reported later that night. A soldier, Joe, informs another about Pete's severe injury, stating, "HEY, JOE, YOUR PAL, PETE CIRILLO IS IN A PRETTY BAD WAY. HIS LEGS! THEY'RE SENDIN' HIM BACK TO A BASE HOSPITAL! HE'S IN THERE IF YOU WANNA SAY GOOD-BYE!" The injured Pete is then described as being sent back to camp when the tanks were spotted, with the dialogue revealing his heroic actions: "PETE - WOUNDED? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! I SENT HIM BACK TO CAMP WHEN THE TANKS WERE SPOTTED!"

In the final panels, Joe expresses his admiration for Pete's bravery, saying, "JOE, THAT WAS A FINE PIECE OF WORK YOU DID. I'M PUTTING YOU IN FOR THE BRONZE STAR!" Another soldier, Captain, agrees, adding, "THANKS, CAPTAIN!" The page concludes with a reflection on Pete's actions, as another soldier comments, "YEAH? WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN'T GO! SCOUTS FOUND HIM OUT THERE WITH THOSE RED TANKS! HE'D KNOCKED OUT TWO OF THEM WITH GRENADES BEFORE THEY GOT HIM!" This dialogue highlights the soldiers' appreciation for Pete's selfless sacrifice and the impact of his actions on the battle outcome.
