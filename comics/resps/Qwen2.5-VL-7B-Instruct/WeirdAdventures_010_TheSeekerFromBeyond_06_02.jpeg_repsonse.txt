The comic book page opens with a chaotic scene on a snowy street where a red car is careening towards a group of people. A woman in a red coat exclaims, "John! That car! It's going to run over him!" The car crashes into the crowd, causing several individuals to fall. Amidst the chaos, a figure in a green costume with a blue headdress and a ray gun appears, firing a blast that seems to cause the car to explode. 

In the next panel, John, who was presumably hit by the car, is seen lying on the ground, covered in what looks like melted snow or ice. Jane, the woman in the red coat, asks anxiously, "John! Are you all right?" John responds weakly, "Y-yes!" The crowd around them looks on in shock.

The following panels show John and Jane discussing the incident. Jane, holding a ray gun, declares, "A miracle! If that lightning bolt hadn't hit the car... she did it... with a ray gun!" John, still in disbelief, questions, "Ray gun? Oh, you must have just imagined it!"

Later, in a bedroom setting, John lies in bed, visibly distressed. He contemplates aloud, "How can I expect her to believe what I saw... or did I really see it?" Jane, standing beside him, advises, "You go right home and lie down for a while, darling!" John, still troubled, thinks, "I can't get that strange girl out of my mind! Did I really see her demolish that car with a ray gun, or was it all a hallucination?"

The page concludes with John lying in bed, his mind reeling from the events he witnessed, questioning whether they were real or a figment of his imagination.
