The comic book page opens with a bustling city scene where the news spreads rapidly. A man in a red hat and coat is seen reading a newspaper titled "Dispatch," which reports on an incident at Midwest City Jail involving an invisible prisoner who has set off dynamite. The tension escalates as another panel shows a figure in a green uniform attempting to defuse the explosion, but the dynamite goes off, causing a fiery explosion.

The narrative shifts to a military command center where a high-ranking officer is on the phone, urgently instructing the National Guard to deploy artillery and alert the Air Force. The urgency is palpable as he declares that they must break into the city before the population panics. The setting changes to a snowy battlefield where soldiers are seen preparing their artillery, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.

In the final panel, the focus returns to the city streets, now chaotic with people running and vehicles overturned. A firefighter is seen using a hose to extinguish fires, while others are seen in panic, shouting about the lack of water and the imminent danger of the whole city burning down due to the invisible threat. The dialogue reveals the desperation and confusion among the citizens and law enforcement, highlighting the dire circumstances they face.
