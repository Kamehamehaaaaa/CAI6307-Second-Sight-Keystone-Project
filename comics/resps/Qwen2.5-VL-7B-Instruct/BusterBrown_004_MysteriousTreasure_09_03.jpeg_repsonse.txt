The comic book page opens with the "Sea Hawk" sailing towards Bandara Island, equipped for a salvage job. The scene shifts to the cove at Bandara Island where the sunken "Island Queen" is easily located. The "Sea Hawk" anchors nearby, but before they can begin salvage operations, a confrontation arises. A man at the helm of the "Sea Hawk" encounters natives who warn him away, declaring the island taboo for white men. The man, realizing his son is sick-to-die due to the presence of white men, understands the natives' perspective. He instructs Kala to fetch the medicine kit and prepares to go ashore. The interaction between the characters highlights cultural tension and misunderstanding, set against the backdrop of a tropical island setting.
