The comic book page opens with a scene at a beauty parlor, where a young girl with blonde hair is entering the establishment. The sign above reads "Beauty Parlor" and advertises "Children's Haircuts Our Specialty." Inside, a character named Lester, a small dog wearing a red hat, is seated in a chair, while another character, possibly a child, is getting a haircut from a stylist dressed in blue. The stylist is holding a comb and appears to be instructing Lester to read a magazine.

In the next panel, Lester is shown reading a magazine, exclaiming, "Bah! I've already read these old magazines!" This indicates his boredom with the task at hand. The following panel shows Lester sitting in a red chair, thinking, "This waiting around is boring," further emphasizing his impatience.

The narrative then shifts to a shadowy figure peeking through a curtain, whispering, "I wonder what is in there!" This adds an element of curiosity or suspense to the story. Finally, the last panel reveals Lester, now with a perm, excitedly exclaiming, "Hmmm... A permanent wave machine! On me it would look good!" This suggests that Lester has discovered a new way to pass the time and perhaps improve his appearance, adding a humorous twist to the story.
