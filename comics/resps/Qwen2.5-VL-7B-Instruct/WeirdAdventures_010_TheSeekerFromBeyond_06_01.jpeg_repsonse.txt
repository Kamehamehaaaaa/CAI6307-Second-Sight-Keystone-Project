The comic book page opens with the title "The Seeker from Beyond" prominently displayed at the top. The scene is set in a dimly lit bar, where John Grant and Jane are seated at a table adorned with a bouquet of roses and drinks. John, dressed in a brown suit, is engaged in conversation with Jane, who is wearing a red jacket and a matching headscarf. She appears concerned, exclaiming, "What is it, Jane? What are you staring at?" Meanwhile, a mysterious figure in a green dress and headdress stands behind them, her gaze fixed on John, creating an eerie atmosphere. The dialogue continues with Jane warning, "That girl--! She hasn't taken her eyes off you since we sat down, John! There's something... eerie about her!"

The narrative progresses as the scene shifts to the street outside the bar. Jane, still in her red jacket, asks John, "And now she's following us! Do you know her, John? Who is she?" John responds, "I've never seen her before!" Suddenly, the tension escalates as the mysterious figure lunges towards John, who is now in a blue coat, causing him to fall backward into a red car. The final panel shows the figure looming over the car, with Jane shouting, "Look out!" The page concludes with the word "At Work," hinting at the character's occupation or role.
