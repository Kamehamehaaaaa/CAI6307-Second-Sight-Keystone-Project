The comic book page titled "WILLIE" features a sequence of six panels depicting a confrontation between two boys on a street. The first panel shows one boy, wearing a yellow shirt and black shorts, chasing another boy who is dressed in a striped shirt and green pants. The second panel captures the moment when the boy in the striped shirt falls to the ground, with the boy in yellow standing over him, saying, "GET UP! I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU YET."

In the third panel, the boy in the striped shirt, now lying on the ground, responds with, "WHY WILLIE~YOU SHOULDN'T FIGHT LIKE THAT." The setting shifts slightly, showing a rural backdrop with a red barn and a chimney smoking in the distance.

The fourth panel introduces an adult male figure, dressed in a checkered suit and hat, who approaches the boys. He says, "HE CALLED MY SISTER A LOT OF NAMES," indicating that the boy in the striped shirt has been verbally abusive towards someone else's sister.

In the fifth panel, the adult continues, "BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANY SISTER," suggesting that the boy in the striped shirt is mistaken or lying about his sister's identity. The boy in the striped shirt, still on the ground, replies, "I KNOW I HAVEN'T."

The final panel shows the adult, now more animated, exclaiming, "I WAS FIGHTIN' FOR TH' PRINCIPLE OF THE THING," implying that the boy in the striped shirt was defending himself against an unjustified attack. The adult's expression and posture suggest he is trying to reason with the boy in yellow, possibly attempting to mediate the situation.
