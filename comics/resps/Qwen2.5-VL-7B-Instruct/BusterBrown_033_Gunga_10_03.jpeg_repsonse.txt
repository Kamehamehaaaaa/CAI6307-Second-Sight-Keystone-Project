The comic book page depicts a dramatic scene involving an elephant and a man named Babu. The setting appears to be a jungle or a forested area near an elephant yard, as indicated by the presence of the elephant and the hut-like structure. 

In the first panel, a man, identified as Babu, is seen running away from an elephant that is chasing him. The text above the elephant reads "BACK, PADMAH! BACK!" suggesting that the elephant is named Padmah and is urging the man to retreat. Babu is depicted in a hurry, with his back turned to the viewer, indicating his fear and urgency.

In the second panel, Babu races towards an empty hut near the edge of the elephant yard. He lunges inside, seeking refuge. The text here describes his desperate attempt to escape the elephant's wrath.

The third panel shows the elephant continuing its pursuit, with the text stating, "...BUT THERE IS NO STOPPING THE INFURIATED BEAST..." This panel emphasizes the elephant's anger and determination to catch Babu.

In the fourth panel, the elephant is shown crashing through the hut, with the text reading, "...AND SOON BABU'S FRAIL REFUGE CRUMBLES UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE RAGING ELEPHANT..." This panel captures the moment of Babu's refuge collapsing under the elephant's forceful entry.

Finally, in the fifth panel, the elephant is seen walking away, leaving Babu behind. The text at the bottom of this panel states, "...AND PADMAH GOES BACK TO THE JUNGLE!" This indicates that the elephant has returned to its natural habitat, leaving Babu alone and presumably injured or exhausted after the ordeal.

The sequence of panels portrays a tense and dangerous situation where Babu's attempts to escape the elephant's aggression are ultimately futile, leading to his isolation in the jungle.
