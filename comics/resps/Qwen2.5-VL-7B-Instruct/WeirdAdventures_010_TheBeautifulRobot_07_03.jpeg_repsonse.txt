The comic book page opens with a scene where the Professor is meticulously training his creation, Katha, on how to speak. The dialogue reveals that Katha is learning the alphabet, specifically focusing on the letter "I." The Professor's instruction is met with a curious response from Katha, who asks what "I" means. This interaction sets the stage for the character's learning process.

In the next panel, Katha is seen in a more formal setting, possibly a laboratory or office, where she is being instructed by the Professor on the concept of kissing. The Professor explains that kissing involves placing one pair of lips against another, and he offers to demonstrate. Katha, dressed in a green top and red skirt, appears both intrigued and slightly apprehensive about the task at hand.

The narrative progresses to show Katha practicing her new skill in a domestic setting, where she confidently says, "I love you," and "Good girl! And now, kiss me!" The Professor, still in his lab coat, gestures towards her, encouraging her to proceed. The scene captures a moment of learning and growth for Katha, as she navigates the complexities of human interaction.

The final panels reveal a social gathering, likely a wedding reception, where Katha meets Jim and Barbara. The Professor, who has been absent, surprises everyone by attending the event. The text indicates that the Professor realizes the importance of exposing Katha to more human interactions, which might help her better understand and adapt to human society. The scene concludes with a warm greeting from Katha, acknowledging the pleasant surprise of seeing the Professor at the reception, highlighting the successful integration of Katha into a human environment.
