The comic book page opens with a scene of three men crouched low in the grass, their backs turned to the viewer, suggesting they are on a stealthy mission. The text above them reads, "GUNGA TRIES THE MOST DANGEROUS OF HUNTS, THE LONE KEEDAH!" This sets the stage for an intense hunt. One man, identified as Gunga, is speaking, saying, "I HOPE HE DOES NOT TAKE CHANCES, BABU." Another man responds, "IF ANYONE CAN MAKE A LONE KEEDAH SUCCESSFULLY, MY FRIEND, IT IS GUNGA." The setting is a lush, green jungle with high grass and scattered trees, indicating a wild and untamed environment.

The narrative then shifts to show Gunga crawling silently through the tall grass, his movements barely audible. The text explains, "SILENTLY AND UNSEEN, THE JUNGLE-BRED GUNGA CRAWLS THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS UNTIL HE IS UNDER A GREAT COW ELEPHANT. BUT SHE IS NOT PADMAH... HE MUST SEEK FURTHER..." This indicates that Gunga's target is not Padmah, the elephant he was originally looking for, but rather another one.

The next panel introduces a new character: a wise old bull elephant. The text reads, "ONE WISE OLD BULL IS SUSPICIOUS, AND GUNGA 'FREEZES.'" Gunga is depicted lying flat on the ground, his body tense and alert, as the bull elephant approaches him. The tension between Gunga and the bull is palpable, highlighting the danger and suspense of the hunt.

The final panel shows Gunga still on the ground, his posture unchanged, as the bull elephant stands over him, its large tusks and imposing presence dominating the frame. The text reiterates, "ONE WISE OLD BULL IS SUSPICIOUS, AND GUNGA 'FREEZES.'" This emphasizes Gunga's careful and calculated approach to the hunt, even when faced with a potentially dangerous situation. The overall atmosphere of the page is one of suspense and anticipation, as Gunga navigates the challenges of his hunt in the wild.
