The comic book page opens with a serene scene of two ships, the "Sea Hawk" and the "Island Queen," floating on calm waters under a clear sky. The narrative begins with a caption that reads, "After 24 hours of hard work, Kala and Chad sleep soundly, unaware of their rapidly approaching visitors... Next to the 'Sea Hawk' floats the 'Island Queen,' the mysterious ship..." This sets the stage for an impending confrontation.

The next panel introduces three men on the deck of the "Island Queen." One man, dressed in a brown suit, is holding a machine gun and exclaims, "Come on, boys! We've taken them by surprise..." His companions, one in a purple shirt and green pants and another in a blue sweater, nod in agreement. The tension is palpable as they prepare to confront the sleeping crew of the "Sea Hawk."

The scene shifts to the interior of the "Sea Hawk," where two men are seen through a window. One man, wearing a hat, looks out with a concerned expression while the other, in a yellow shirt, speaks into a microphone, saying, "Okay, below! Up and outta there! Or we blast the 'Sea Hawk' to slivers! Two machine guns on ya, so come up!" The urgency in his voice underscores the danger they face.

In the final panel, the focus returns to the "Island Queen." A man in a yellow shirt is seen speaking to another man in a brown suit, who is gesturing emphatically. The dialogue reveals that Kala has gone ashore, and they need to post a lookout to intercept him when he returns. The urgency is evident as they instruct Billow to hurry aboard the "Swift" and make haste.

The page captures a moment of high tension and anticipation, with the characters on both ships engaged in a critical situation that threatens to escalate into violence.
