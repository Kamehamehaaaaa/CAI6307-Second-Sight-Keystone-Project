The comic book page opens with a scene inside a dimly lit room where a man in a green suit is bent over another man who lies on the floor, seemingly unconscious or worse. The man in the green suit exclaims, "LOOK -- NICK!" indicating urgency. The next panel shows him checking the body, noting that it's still warm, while another character, Al, suggests there might be a phone call to make. 

The narrative then shifts to several hours later at police headquarters, where Inspector Dykes is questioning two men. One of them, Carl, is being accused of something by the other, who is not named. Inspector Dykes asks if they can go now, and Carl responds that he doesn't think the story matches theirs. The dialogue reveals a tense atmosphere as the inspector tries to piece together the events.

In the following panels, the focus returns to the initial scene, where the man in the green suit is now explaining to someone off-panel about a dog and a reclusive old man. He accuses them of having killed the old recluse and demands they stop playing with jigsaw puzzles and get out of the mess. The final panel shows a close-up of the man in the green suit, emphasizing his frustration and the gravity of the situation.

Throughout the page, the interactions between the characters are marked by tension and suspicion, hinting at a complex mystery involving murder and a missing fortune.
