The comic book page features a whimsical adventure involving anthropomorphic animals in a mountainous setting. The first panel shows a frog dressed as an eagle, confidently declaring, "I'M AN EAGLE, I AM, I AM!" while attempting to climb a steep slope. A cat character, also dressed in a costume resembling an eagle, is seen slipping and falling down the mountain, exclaiming "YOWPPP!" in distress.

In the second panel, a character dressed as a mountain climber asks, "MY GOOTNESS, SMILIN' ED. DID YOU SCHLIPP?" while another character, possibly a guide or companion, looks on with concern. The frog, now back on solid ground, responds to the question, "SMILIN' ED... ARE YOU HURT?" The cat, still on the slope, replies, "NO, BUT I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF MOUNTAIN CLIMBINGâ€”WE'LL NEVER REACH THE TOP!"

The third panel captures the frog's determination as he declares, "HELLO, MR. BIG HORN! I'M GONNA BUTT SOMEBODY!" This statement is met with a mix of amusement and concern from the other characters, who are dressed in colorful, traditional attire. The cat, now back on the ground, suggests, "WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK!" while the frog retorts, "IF YOU GOTTA BUTT SOMEBODY, THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS NICE AN' SOFT!" The final panel shows the frog interacting with a goat-like character, emphasizing his playful and determined nature despite the challenges they face.
