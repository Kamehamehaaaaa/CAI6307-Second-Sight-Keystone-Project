The comic book page opens with a man in a suit and hat, labeled "GRAB IT, LADY!" He is on the beach, seemingly in a hurry, as he tosses a life preserver towards a woman in a swimsuit. The setting is a sunny beach with a backdrop of water and distant trees. The woman catches the life preserver, and the man continues running.

In the next panel, the man, now shirtless and wearing shorts, stands near a car with a sign that reads "FREE PARKING." He exclaims, "AHA! SO WE GOT A TIRE THIEF AROUND HERE~HEY!!" This suggests he has noticed someone stealing tires from the car.

The scene shifts back to the beach where the man, still in his suit, is now holding the life preserver. The woman, now wearing a red bandana, thanks him profusely, saying, "OH, THANK YOU, SIR! YOU SAVED MY LIFE!" The man responds modestly, "DON'T MENTION IT, LADY."

In another panel, the woman, still on the beach, expresses her gratitude again, "YOU ARE A REAL HERO! I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN EVER REPAY YOU." The man, now appearing slightly embarrassed, replies, "AW, SHUCKS! IT WAS NOTHIN'!!"

The final two panels show the man and the woman on the beach. The woman, now wearing a red bandana and high heels, leans in close to the man, who is still in his suit. She says, "YOU WONDERFUL MAN!!" Suddenly, she slaps him across the face, and the word "SMACK!" appears above her hand. The man, now in a close-up, looks surprised and slightly hurt, with a cigarette hanging from his mouth and a small bruise forming on his cheek.
