The comic book page opens with a scene of Katha, dressed in a red dress, engaging with several men at what appears to be a formal event. The dialogue reveals her popularity among the men, with one man expressing jealousy and another suggesting she belongs to him. The setting is a well-dressed gathering, possibly a ball or a party, indicated by the formal attire and the presence of other elegantly dressed individuals.

In the next panel, Katha is seen whispering to a man named Bill, who is kissing Barbara, another woman in a wedding dress. Katha's expression and the text reveal her intent to steal Bill from Barbara, indicating a subplot involving romantic rivalry and theft of a man.

The scene shifts to an outdoor setting where Katha, still in her red dress, confronts Bill and Barbara on their wedding day. The text suggests that Katha has been kissing Bill against his will for the past ten minutes, adding a layer of conflict and drama to the narrative. The interaction between Katha, Bill, and Barbara is intense, with Katha's actions causing confusion and distress for both Bill and Barbara.

The final panels show Katha and Bill sharing a kiss, while Barbara, now in a white dress, looks on with a mix of surprise and anger. The text from Professor Kingsley, who is also present, adds to the tension, warning Bill about Katha's actions and suggesting that she has gone too far. The overall atmosphere is one of chaos and emotional turmoil, highlighting the consequences of Katha's actions and the complex relationships between the characters involved.
