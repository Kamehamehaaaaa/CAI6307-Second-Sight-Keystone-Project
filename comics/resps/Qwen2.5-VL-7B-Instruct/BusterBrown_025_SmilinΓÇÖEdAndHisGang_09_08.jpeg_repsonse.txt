The comic book page features a whimsical winter scene with anthropomorphic animal characters. In the first panel, a frog named Smilin' Ed is seen struggling in icy water, while a mouse dressed as a bee and a cat in a red outfit rush towards him on skis, determinedly saying, "Hang on, Smilin' Ed. We'll rescue you!" The background shows a snowy landscape with trees and a clear sky.

In the second panel, Smilin' Ed is now on a makeshift sled, being pulled by the mouse and the cat. The mouse exclaims, "We got you, Smilin' Ed!" while the cat adds, "Upsy Daisy!" The setting remains the same snowy landscape.

The third panel introduces a new character, a large, shaggy dog-like figure dressed in a fur coat and hat, who appears to be a traveler. He observes the scene with concern, saying, "Smilin' Ed looks like a glacier, he does! He does!" The mouse and the cat respond with urgency, "My goodness, Mr. Traveller, we've got to melt him!" The dog-like figure seems to be pondering their plan, saying, "For graciousness sakes, let me think!"

In the fourth panel, the dog-like figure, now identified as Ice-Cube McConnell, is shown with a fire, warming up Smilin' Ed. The mouse and the cat comment, "Ja! Dot's vat he needed, a leedle warmness!" and "Ice-Cube McConnell they called him in them days." The dog-like figure, now feeling better, says, "Smilin' Ed, the last good time ve vill have at Zun Valley is on skis. Now I vill show you a slalom!" The mouse and the cat, still dressed as bees, enthusiastically agree, "I'd rather you'd show me a bed," and "I'm a good skier, I am, I am!"

The comic captures a humorous and heartwarming interaction between the characters, set against a picturesque winter backdrop, emphasizing themes of friendship, teamwork, and the joy of outdoor activities.
