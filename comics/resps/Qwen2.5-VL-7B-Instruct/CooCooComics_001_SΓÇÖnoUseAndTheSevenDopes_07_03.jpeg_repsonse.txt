The comic book page opens with a young girl in a red dress asking a passing rodent if she knows where she is. The rodent responds affirmatively, pointing out her location. As night falls, the girl, now alone, expresses surprise and fear, indicated by the "Oh!" and "Crash!" sounds. She then wanders through a forest, searching for food, shelter, a shortcut, a tall prince charming, and the way out, as stated in the panel.

Suddenly, she discovers a house, exclaiming, "Oh! It's a house!" but quickly realizes that the lady of the house doesn't live there. Inside the house, she encounters a group of seven dwarfs who greet her warmly, despite her initial concerns about being disgusting and repulsive. The dwarfs, each with their own quirky self-assessment ("I'm nauseating," "I'm repulsive," "I'm inedible," "I'm incredible," "I'm just a dope"), welcome her with open arms, saying, "Welcome to the House of the Seven Dopes!" and "I'm pleased to meet yo' all."

The interaction between the girl and the dwarfs is filled with humor and charm, showcasing a classic fairy tale twist where the girl finds unexpected hospitality in an unconventional setting.
