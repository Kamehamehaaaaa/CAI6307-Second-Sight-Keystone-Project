The comic book page opens with a man driving home, his mind racing with thoughts about the word "tomorrow." He feels an eerie sense of unease, wondering if tomorrow will come for him. As he pulls up to the curb, he realizes something is amiss; the car is moving backward, and he has no control over it. The scene shifts to a close-up of the man's face, showing his confusion and fear. He exclaims, "What kind of double-talk is that, Mike? It's no time for a joke..." 

In another panel, we see the man from behind, looking into a mirror where he sees himself talking backwards. The text reads, "I'm back again, Mike... but I don't know how I got here or why... I'm in some... snoitalutargnoc, ris. tub worromot si a gnol syaw ffo. ah! uoy nac llits egnahc ruoy dnim." This cryptic message adds to the mystery and disorientation.

The narrative continues with the man questioning his surroundings, saying, "Mike wasn't talking gibberish! He was talking backwards! And I... I'm moving backwards! Living backwards!" The final panel shows the man in a room, with another character in a red coat standing beside him, seemingly concerned. The man's expression conveys a mix of shock and realization, highlighting the surreal and unsettling nature of the situation.
