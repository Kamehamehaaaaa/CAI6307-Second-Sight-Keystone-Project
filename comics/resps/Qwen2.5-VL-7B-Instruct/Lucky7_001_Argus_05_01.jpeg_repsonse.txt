The comic book page opens with a scene inside a bar where three men are seated. One of them, dressed in a green suit, is explaining their recent encounter with a drunk who had asked for directions home. The other two men, one in a striped shirt and the other in a dark suit, listen attentively. The man in the green suit mentions that their advertisement in the "N.Y. Star" has brought them business, suggesting they are a team of detectives or private investigators.

The conversation shifts as the man in the striped shirt asks what they can do for him, indicating he's a customer seeking help. The man in the green suit responds by saying, "Patience, my lad," while the man in the dark suit adds, "What can we do for you, young man?" The man in the striped shirt then asks if they have found his dog named Pal, to which the man in the green suit replies, "Find Pal, my dog! Got any money?"

The scene transitions to an outdoor setting where the trio decides to search for Pal. The man in the striped shirt explains that Pal always waits for him at a specific location when he comes from school. They decide to ask around the neighborhood, specifically at a house over there, hoping someone might have seen Pal.

The next panel shows the trio knocking on a door, with the man in the striped shirt asking if anyone has seen a little dog around. The man at the door, wearing a suit, responds dismissively, "No time for dogs!" Recognizing the voice of their friend, the trio rushes into the house, exclaiming, "My Pal!"

Inside, they find the house in disarray, with the man in the striped shirt exclaiming, "What a horrible place! I wonder who lives in such filth?" The scene captures a moment of surprise and concern as the trio discovers the state of the house, highlighting the urgency and determination of their mission to locate Pal.
