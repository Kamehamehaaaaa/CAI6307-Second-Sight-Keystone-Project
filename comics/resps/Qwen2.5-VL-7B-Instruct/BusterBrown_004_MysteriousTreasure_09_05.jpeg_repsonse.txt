The comic book page opens with Chad and Kala on the "Sea Hawk," preparing for an operation. Chad, equipped with a gas mask and tool kit, descends into the water to block openings while Kala runs the pump from above. The intercommunication phones relay their plans. Chad covers every hole in the hull except one port, ensuring that when they start the pump, the water will be released, allowing the old schooner to float again.

The scene shifts to the bottom of the sea where the old schooner lies, its hull water-filled. As air enters her hold, water begins to eject through the open port, pushing against the sea. The schooner, now filled with air, fights the waves, struggling to rise once more. 

In the final panel, two men, one shirtless and the other in a yellow shirt, kneel on the deck of the "Sea Hawk." They exclaim, "Oh boy!!! Hot dog! We two golblamed smart fellas, hey, Chad?" indicating their satisfaction with the successful salvage operation. The background shows the schooner rising from the depths, partially submerged but visibly fighting back against the sea.
