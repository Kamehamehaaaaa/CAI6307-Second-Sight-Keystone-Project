The comic book page depicts a scene set in the jungle, where a group of men, dressed in traditional attire with head coverings, are engaged in a discussion about an elephant named Padmah. The setting is vibrant, with lush greenery and a backdrop that suggests a tropical environment. The dialogue reveals a sense of urgency and concern among the characters.

In the first panel, one character exclaims, "Aie, Babu! Padmah went berserk?" indicating that Padmah, a wild elephant, has escaped their control. Another character responds, "She did. I could not control her. Now she has run off into the jungle," highlighting the difficulty they face in managing Padmah's behavior.

The second panel shows the group discussing Padmah's potential capture. One character states, "Padmah can be trained but she is very wild and headstrong, and it will take much time and patience." This suggests that while Padmah can be tamed, it will require significant effort and time.

In the third panel, another character expresses frustration, saying, "We must follow her and bring her back!" This indicates the group's determination to recapture Padmah despite the challenges.

The fourth panel introduces a new character, Gunga, who is concerned about the young tusker elephant. He says, "Such is so. Too much work will make him rebellious, because he is so young," showing his worry for the young elephant's well-being.

The fifth panel continues the conversation with Gunga stating, "I have lost a valuable elephant! Now I am fearful of my position with His Highness," reflecting the consequences of losing Padmah and the impact on his status.

In the sixth panel, Gunga advises, "You have no need to fear. He knows that Padmah is a mean cow. Go back to the stables and bring that huge coil of rope with the Keddah hook on it. I will attempt a lone Keddah," suggesting a plan to capture Padmah using a specialized rope.

The final panel shows Gunga holding the Keddah rope, with another character saying, "I am not afraid, but it is too near to evening now. Tomor
