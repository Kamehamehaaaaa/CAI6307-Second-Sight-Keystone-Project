The comic book page opens with a cheerful greeting from Mr. Havcash to Mary, who is out for a stroll. The setting appears to be an outdoor area, possibly a park or a street, given the presence of a lamppost and the open sky visible in the background of one panel. Mr. Havcash, dressed in a top hat and formal attire, engages Mary in conversation, which he humorously describes as "blah-blah-blah-blah... how this old geezer can talk! What a chatterbox!" This suggests that Mr. Havcash is a talkative character, perhaps a bit of a bore.

Mary, depicted with a red bow in her hair and wearing a red dress, seems to be enjoying the interaction but also finds Mr. Havcash's verbosity amusing. Her expression shifts from polite to slightly exasperated as she thinks, "I gotta do something about this wind-bag or we'll be here all day!" This internal monologue indicates her desire to end the conversation quickly.

In the next panel, a sheep, presumably Mary's pet, looks on with a concerned expression. The sheep's thought bubble reveals its intention: "This ought to stop him in his tracks!" The sheep then proceeds to blow a large gust of wind, which Mr. Havcash is not prepared for. The wind catches him off guard, causing him to be blown away, leaving a trail of stars behind him. The final panel shows Mr. Havcash tumbling down, with the sheep still standing, looking triumphant. Mary, now with a smile, says goodbye to Mr. Havcash, wishing him a nice trip, while the sheep adds, "Yeah... have a nice trip, hey!" This concludes the comic strip with a humorous twist, where the sheep uses its natural ability to control the wind to silence Mr. Havcash's incessant chatter.
