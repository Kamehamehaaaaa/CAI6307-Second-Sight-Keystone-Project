The comic book page depicts a scene from a story involving Jafara and Karim, who have climbed quickly to the roof of a structure. They then call upon an unwilling jinn through a magic leather cord. The jinn, with a menacing appearance, is summoned by Jafara, who commands the jinn to break a spell. The jinn instructs them to go to the Lake of Lavender, catch an orange fish, a scarlet fish, and a green fish, cook them in clarified butter, and give them to the Caliph to eat.

In the next panel, Karim transforms the jinn into a giant bird, which carries Jafara and himself to the Lavender Lake. The bird soars miles in the air, and in no time, they swoop down to land on the shores of Lavender Lake. The setting is depicted with lush greenery and a serene lake, contrasting sharply with the earlier urban environment. The bird's wings are large and detailed, emphasizing its size and the fantastical nature of the scene. 

As they land, Karim observes the lake, noting that it is swarming with the required fish. The interaction between the characters and their environment highlights the urgency and magical elements of their quest. The dialogue and visual storytelling convey a sense of adventure and the use of supernatural forces to achieve their goal.
