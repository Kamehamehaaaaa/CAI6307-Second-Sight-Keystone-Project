The comic book page opens with a tense scene inside a police station where the Mayor of Midwest City receives a phone call. The dialogue reveals a demand for a million dollars in small bills, threatening dire consequences if the money isn't delivered. The mayor, visibly distressed, pleads for the caller to think about the impact on people's lives before demanding payment.

The narrative then shifts to a domestic setting where Anna is seen in a state of distress, blaming herself for a mysterious machine that might cause the dome to remain sealed forever. She expresses her fear of revealing the truth to Lars, who is unaware of the situation. Anna's desperation is palpable as she pleads with Lars not to leave, fearing he might be the one who overheard their conversation.

In another panel, Anna and Lars are shown in a heated argument. Anna, visibly upset, accuses Lars of being the one who overheard them talking about the machine. The tension escalates as Anna demands to know where Lars has gone, suspecting him of involvement. Lars, however, denies any knowledge and insists that he just went out.

The final panels depict Anna and Lars leaving the house, with Anna determined to follow Lars to confront him. She believes he is the one responsible for the situation and wants him to face consequences. The scene concludes with Anna and Lars walking away from the house, Anna's resolve unyielding as she follows Lars, determined to uncover the truth behind the mysterious events unfolding in Midwest City.
