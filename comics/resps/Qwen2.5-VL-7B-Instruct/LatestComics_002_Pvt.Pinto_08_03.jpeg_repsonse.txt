The comic book page opens with a group of soldiers gathered around a piece of paper, exclaiming "Not bad, eh Sarge? It's a picture of my girl, Lulu!" The scene shifts to a close-up of the picture, which reads "To my pal Joey." The next panel shows a soldier holding the picture, pondering with "HMMMM!" The following panel depicts two soldiers discussing the picture, one saying, "Y'know good taste, Private, er. Don't ya think she ought t' meet yer sarge, sometime?" The final panel on the left shows a soldier lying down, dreaming about meeting the pin-up girl, with the thought bubble stating, "If I could just meet that pin-up platter, she'll forget there ever was a crow named Pinto!" The last panel on the right is labeled "The Following Sunday" and shows a woman entering a building, greeted by a soldier who calls out, "Lulu!"
