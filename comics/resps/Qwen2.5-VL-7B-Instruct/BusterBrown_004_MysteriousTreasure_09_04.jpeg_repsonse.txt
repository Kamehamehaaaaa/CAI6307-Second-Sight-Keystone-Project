The comic book page opens with a scene on Bandara Island where a group of men, led by one in a yellow shirt and blue pants, is addressing a crowd of indigenous people. The man in the yellow shirt speaks, saying, "We have come to try and make your son well," while another man, standing among the crowd, responds, "If you make boy good, me be your friend all time!" This interaction sets a tone of goodwill and cooperation.

The narrative then shifts to a different setting, aboard the ship "Swift," where Beau Dillon and his companion Ham Stone are engaged in conversation. Beau, dressed in a suit and hat, confirms that they have spotted the "Sea Hawk" in the cove, using binoculars and a Marconi rig for identification. Ham, wearing a blue cap and scarf, expresses concern about their next move, suggesting they should stand off shore and wait, possibly due to an old man named Mooney who might know the location of the "Island Queen" and its treasure. Beau agrees, stating, "Not yet! We'll stand off shore and wait... maybe old Mooney told him where the 'Island Queen' and the treasure is! If he raises it, we'll go out and take over."

The final panel returns to the island, where Chad and Kala are tending to a boy's leg infection. The text reveals that the boy's illness was caused by a long sliver in his leg, which had spread, making him extremely weak with fever. Chad, dressed in a yellow shirt and blue pants, is seen working diligently to clean the wound, while Kala, in a green outfit, assists him. The text concludes with Chad's reassuring statement, "I've got the sliver, Kala! Now we'll sterilize the wound, and he'll be on the road to recovery!"

This page captures a blend of adventure and humanitarian efforts, contrasting the potential for conflict between the two ships with the compassionate actions of Chad and Kala on Bandara Island.
