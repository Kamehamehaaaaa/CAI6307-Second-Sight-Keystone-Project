The comic book page opens with a scene where a character, dressed in a green uniform, is seen hitting a woman in a red dress. The dialogue box above the woman reads, "NEVER HIT A WOMAN IN MY LIFE, BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES..." indicating a humorous or ironic situation. The next panel shows the same character, now in a more dynamic pose, saying, "BULL'S EYE! NOW TO SEE THE SCORE!" suggesting he's aiming for something specific.

In the following panels, the character, still in the green uniform, is seen lying on the ground, looking disoriented. He exclaims, "A WIG! JUST AS I THOUGHT! YOU'RE NOT MY LULU! YOU'RE A SPY IN DISGUISE... A NASTY SPY!" This reveals that the woman is not who she appears to be but rather a spy. The next panel shows her reacting with surprise and distress, saying, "BAH! MY SABOTAGE CAREER IS OVER!" while the character in the green uniform responds, "YOU'RE NOT KIDDIN' BROTHER!"

The narrative continues with another scene where the character in the green uniform is seen escorting the woman, now identified as a man, around a post. The man asks, "WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS ESCORTIN' HER 'ROUND THE POST!!" The final panel captures the moment of realization: "THIS IS GONNA BE HER LAST ESCORT 'ROUND ANY POST... AND IT AIN'T A HER... IT'S A HIM!" The man, now understanding his mistake, exclaims, "WELL, I'LL BE!" while the woman, realizing the truth, covers her face in embarrassment or frustration.

The comic uses exaggerated expressions and dialogue to create a humorous and light-hearted tone, typical of classic comic book storytelling. The interactions between the characters highlight themes of mistaken identity and the comedic consequences of such misunderstandings.
