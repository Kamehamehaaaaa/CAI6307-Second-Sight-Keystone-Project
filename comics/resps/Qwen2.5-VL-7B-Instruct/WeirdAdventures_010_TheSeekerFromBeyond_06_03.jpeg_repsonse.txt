The comic book page opens with an eerie glow appearing before John, a man in a white shirt and brown pants, who is lying on a bed. A figure in a green and gold outfit, identified as Zada, Queen of the Planet Xedes, approaches him. She declares, "YOU! I HAVE COME, BELOVED!" John responds with surprise, "YOU!" The scene shifts to a more intimate setting where John and Zada are in close proximity, with Zada saying, "WHAT... DO YOU WANT OF... ME?" John replies, "LOOK, JOHN GRANT, AND YOU SHALL SEE..." 

The narrative then transitions to a grand hall filled with soldiers and armored figures, suggesting a military assembly. Zada, now in a more regal attire, addresses the crowd, stating, "SO MANDOR HAS RAISED AN ARMY AGAINST THE RULER OF XEDES! HE SHALL PAY FOR HIS TREACHERY... EVEN THO I LOVE HIM!" This indicates a conflict between Mandor and the ruler of Xedes.

The final panels depict a dramatic scene of space warfare. A red and yellow spaceship is shown being destroyed by a large explosion, with the text "BA-ROOM!" emphasizing the impact. The last panel shows Zada and another character, possibly a general or advisor, in a room adorned with curtains and a throne-like chair. Zada declares, "VICTORY, MY QUEEN!" while the other character adds, "A HOLLOW VICTORY... MY BELOVED MANDOR IS DEAD!" This suggests that despite their victory, Zada's love for Mandor has been lost, adding a tragic element to the story.
