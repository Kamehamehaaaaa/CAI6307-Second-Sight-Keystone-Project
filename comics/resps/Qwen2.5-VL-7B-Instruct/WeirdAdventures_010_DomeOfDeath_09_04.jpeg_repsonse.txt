The comic book page opens with a scene inside a train car where a woman in a red dress is urgently speaking to a man in a green suit. She exclaims, "Lars! Lars! Are you all right?" The man responds with a distressed, "Ooh! My head! Got to go after them! Call... police..." The woman pleads, "No, Lars! It's murder... We can't get mixed up in it for the children's sake! Why? We don't even know if that machine really works!" The man considers her advice, saying, "Maybe... You're right! Can't... think! Let's go home... Think it over..."

The narrative shifts to an outdoor setting at the outskirts of town where a freight train is pulling out of the yards. A man in a white shirt and green pants is seen opening a door, with another man in a blue uniform standing nearby. The first man says, "Okay, Mac - open 'er up an' let's roll!" The scene then cuts to a group of men in blue uniforms gathered around a damaged train car, with one man in a yellow jacket exclaiming, "Good grief! They smashed up!" Another man in a green jacket adds, "But but how? They didn't hit nothin'!"

The final panel shows a red car speeding down a highway. Inside the car, a man in a green jacket shouts, "Mike, look! A crackup! But there was nothin' there!" Another man in a yellow jacket responds, "Whatever it is, Mike - stop! Slam on the br..." The scene ends dramatically with the man in the yellow jacket screaming, "I can't! We're goin' too fas - AAAGHHHH!!!"
