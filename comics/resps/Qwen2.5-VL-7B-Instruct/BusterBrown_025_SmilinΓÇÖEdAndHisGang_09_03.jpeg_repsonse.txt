The comic book page features a humorous and adventurous scene set on a mountain. The dialogue suggests a group of characters embarking on a climb, with one character expressing concern about the steepness and danger of the ascent. The characters include a man in traditional Alpine attire, a cat-like figure named Midnight, a frog named Smilin' Ed, and a bird, possibly an eagle, perched on a rock.

In the first panel, the man, holding an ice axe, instructs the group, "Now--ve schtick togedder, und ve climb straight up. If anybody schlips und falls, ve gotta hold him." Midnight, with a worried expression, replies, "Goodness, I wonder if this isn't a little too dangerous," while Smilin' Ed adds, "Smilin' Ed is almost as big as a mountain. He is. He is."

The second panel shows Midnight exclaiming, "Ja, diss is der life, hey Smilin' Ed?" as they continue their climb. Midnight then remarks, "My goodness, mountain climbing is easy, isn't it, Midnight?" to which Midnight responds, "Nice!"

In the third panel, the group is seen higher up the mountain, with Midnight still holding onto the rope for support. The final panel depicts Midnight lying on the ground, seemingly exhausted or injured, while the eagle stands nearby, observing the scene.

The interaction between the characters highlights a mix of humor and tension as they navigate the challenging climb, with Midnight's optimism contrasting with the others' concerns. The setting is a rugged mountain landscape, emphasizing the height and difficulty of their adventure.
