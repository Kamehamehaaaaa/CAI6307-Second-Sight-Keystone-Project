The comic book page is titled "GUNGA" in large, bold letters at the top against a vibrant yellow background. The scene depicts Gunga, identified as a mahout, or elephant driver and trainer, riding atop a massive elephant named Teela. Gunga is dressed in traditional attire, including a red turban and a loincloth, and holds a spear in his right hand, suggesting readiness for any potential threats. The setting appears to be an exotic location, possibly in India, given the architectural elements in the background that resemble temple structures with domed roofs and intricate designs.

The text at the bottom of the page provides context: "Gunga, who was mahout, that is, a driver and trainer of elephants to the Maharaja of Bakore, finishes his task and takes his great elephant, Teela, back for a well-needed rest, unaware that a dangerous adventure, 'A lone Keddah,' awaited him." This narrative suggests that Gunga has completed his duties and is returning home, but he is unaware of the impending danger that lies ahead. The interaction between Gunga and Teela is depicted as a harmonious partnership, with Gunga guiding Teela through what seems to be a serene journey back to their resting place. The overall tone of the page hints at an adventurous story to come, filled with suspense and intrigue.
