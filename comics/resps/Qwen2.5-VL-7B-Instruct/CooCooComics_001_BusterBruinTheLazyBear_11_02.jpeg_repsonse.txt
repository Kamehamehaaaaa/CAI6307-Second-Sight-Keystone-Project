The comic book page features a brown bear character engaging in a humorous sequence of events. The story begins with the bear lying in bed, comfortably nestled under a yellow blanket with green and orange stripes. The bear is sound asleep, indicated by the "ZZZ" sound above its head. In the first panel, the bear mumbles, "NOTHING LIKE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP OF A FEW MONTHS... AH-HH!" suggesting a deep, restful slumber.

As the story progresses, the bear's peaceful sleep is disrupted by a dripping noise. The second panel shows the bear still asleep, but the sound of water dripping from the ceiling is now audible, indicated by the "Drip! Drip!" text. The bear remains undisturbed, continuing its slumber.

In the third panel, the bear wakes up abruptly due to the increasing water accumulation on the floor, which is marked by "Splat-TT!" The bear looks startled and concerned, realizing the severity of the situation.

The fourth panel captures the bear's reaction as it jumps out of bed, determined to fix the leak. The bear declares, "I'LL FIX THAT DRATTED LEAK--," showing resolve and determination.

In the final panel, the bear is seen running towards the source of the leak, with a look of urgency on its face. The word "WOW!" emphasizes the bear's surprise or realization that the leak has caused significant damage, as evidenced by the water splashing around the room. The bear's actions transition from a state of comfort to one of action, highlighting the comic's comedic twist where the bear's initial intention to sleep peacefully turns into an urgent task to address the unexpected problem.
