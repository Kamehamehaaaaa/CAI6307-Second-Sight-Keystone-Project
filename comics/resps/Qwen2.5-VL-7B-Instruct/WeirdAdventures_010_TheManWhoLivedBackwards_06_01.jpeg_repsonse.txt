The comic book page opens with the title "The Man Who Lived Backwards!" prominently displayed at the top, setting an intriguing tone for the story. The scene is set in a laboratory where a man in a lab coat is seen working intently on a beaker, suggesting a scientific experiment or discovery in progress. Behind him, another character, possibly a scientist or assistant, observes with a mix of curiosity and concern.

The main character, who appears distressed and sweating profusely, is depicted in the foreground. His expression conveys intense fear and horror, with the caption below him reading: "My soul was steeped in horror... UNDILUTED HORROR! It flooded over me like an overwhelming torrent--and I was powerless within its grip! The UNIMAGINABLE...the 'IMPOSSIBLE' was happening to me, and all I could do was writhe in helpless agony for I was doomed as... 'THE MAN WHO LIVED BACKWARDS!'"

The narrative then shifts to a different setting, likely a social gathering or celebration. A man in a suit is seen making a toast, wishing his friend well for their upcoming wedding. The dialogue box reads: "A TOAST TO YOU, PAUL... AND TO PEGGY! MY BEST WISHES FOR YOUR WEDDING TOMORROW! AND WE MIGHT AS WELL DRINK A TOAST TO TOMORROW AND HAPPINESS!"

In the background, another conversation unfolds between two men outside a building. One man, dressed in a suit, says: "MR. BRANT SAID YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW, MR. MARTIN. CONGRATULATIONS, SIR. BUT TOMORROW IS A LONG WAY'S OFF! HA! HA! YOU CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR MIND."

The page concludes with the man in the suit saying goodbye to David Brant and heading downstairs, where he finds the doorman readying his car. This sequence of events suggests a pivotal moment in the story, hinting at the protagonist's impending reversal of time and the consequences of such a dramatic change.
