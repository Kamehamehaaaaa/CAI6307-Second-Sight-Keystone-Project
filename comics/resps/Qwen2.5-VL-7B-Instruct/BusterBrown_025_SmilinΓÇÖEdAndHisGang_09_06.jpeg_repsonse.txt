The comic book page features a lively scene of characters embarking on an adventurous mountain climb. The top panel shows four anthropomorphic animals—a frog, a mouse, a skunk, and a rabbit—sledding down a snowy slope. The frog exclaims, "Ah-h-h-h-h-h--- This is the way I like to travel!" while the mouse responds, "My, we're going nothin' yet, smilin' Ed. In a minute we'll really take off!" The skunk adds, "He ain't kiddin', he ain't, he ain't!" The rabbit, seated at the back, simply says, "Nice!"

In the middle panels, the sledding continues with the characters maintaining their positions. The background reveals a picturesque mountainous landscape under a clear sky. The bottom panel humorously depicts the aftermath of their descent: the characters have tumbled down the hill, landing in a pile of rocks and snow. The text reads, "And so the mountain climb ended happily and everyone had a grand time..."

The comic captures the essence of camaraderie and the joy of shared adventure, despite the mishap. The characters' expressions and dialogue convey a sense of fun and excitement, even as they face the comedic consequences of their high-speed journey down the mountain.
