The comic book page opens with a soldier crouched behind a rock, observing a tank in the distance. He thinks aloud, "Maybe I can't get through that line! But if I can get those bozos to fire their guns, the scouts from Baker Company will know something is up!" The scene shifts to a close-up of a hand throwing a grenade, followed by an explosion, indicated by the word "BLAMM!" in bold letters.

The narrative then transitions to a chaotic battle scene where tanks are engaged in combat. A soldier is seen running away from the explosions, with another soldier holding a grenade, ready to throw it. The soldier says, "I got four grenades left, then... come on, babies! Come to Papa! And let's hear those guns good and loud!"

Meanwhile, at the scene of the skirmish, a dirty, bedraggled, exhausted figure runs across the line. The dialogue reveals the urgency of the situation: "Cap'n... Cap'n King, there's tanks--red tanks--flank attack!" Another soldier responds, "Burch! Good man! Jackson, bring me a field phone! Joe, where are they?" The tension escalates as the soldiers communicate the critical information about the enemy tanks.

In the final panel, a medic is seen tending to a soldier who has been grazed by a bullet. The medic exclaims, "Man, are you lucky! That bullet just grazed your head!" The injured soldier replies, "Yeah! I musta been out cold for ten minutes!" The page concludes with the medic continuing his work, emphasizing the perilous nature of the battlefield.
