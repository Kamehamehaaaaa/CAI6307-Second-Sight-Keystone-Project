The comic book page opens with a snowy mountain village setting, where a group of characters, including a frog dressed in a red coat and hat, is preparing for an adventure. The frog exclaims, "I'm going to make a fat snowman like Smilin' Ed, I am, I am!" This sets the tone for the day's activities. The scene shifts to a cozy indoor setting where a character in a blue coat is sitting by a fireplace, while another character in a red coat sits beside him, holding a pair of skis. The dialogue here reads, "Ja, Smilin' Ed, we vill schtart the vacation tomorrow by climbing a mountain!" The character by the fireplace responds, "Will we? My goodness, I'd just as soon climb right back into this chair!"

The narrative then transitions to the next morning, where the same group of characters, now dressed in winter gear, is gathered outside. The frog, still in his red attire, encourages them with, "Come! Onward! Dot's der schtuff. Ve climb a mountain!" The other characters, including a small figure in a red hat and boots, join in the excitement. The dialogue continues, "F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Fi-Fi-Fi-Fi-Fi-Oh, nuts, good!" indicating their enthusiasm.

The final panel shows the group embarking on their mountain climb, with the snowy landscape stretching out before them. The text at the bottom reads, "And so Smilin' Ed and his gang go mountain climbing..." The page captures the essence of a fun, adventurous day planned amidst the cold, snowy mountains.
