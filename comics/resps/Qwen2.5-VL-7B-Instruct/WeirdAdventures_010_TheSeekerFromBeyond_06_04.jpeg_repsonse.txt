The comic book page opens with a character, presumably John, recounting his search for someone like his dead lover across various planets. The narrative is set against a backdrop of vibrant, fantastical settings, each panel vividly colored to enhance the dramatic tension. In one scene, John is seen in a close embrace with a woman adorned in regal attire, suggesting a significant connection or confrontation. The dialogue reveals a complex relationship where the woman claims to be his reincarnation, urging him to return to Xedes and share her throne.

The interaction escalates as the woman, identified as Queen Zada, asserts her dominance over John, declaring that no mere Earthwoman can match her. She commands him to come with her, emphasizing her authority and the stakes involved. The emotional intensity is palpable as John resists, expressing his love for another woman named Jane, indicating a deep personal conflict.

The narrative then shifts to a more mundane setting, showing John at work the following morning, his mind still preoccupied with the events of the night before. The cityscape is depicted with bustling activity, cars, and crowds, adding a layer of everyday life contrast to the fantastical elements introduced earlier. The final panel captures John's determination to stop the woman from following him, highlighting his resolve amidst the chaos of his waking world.
