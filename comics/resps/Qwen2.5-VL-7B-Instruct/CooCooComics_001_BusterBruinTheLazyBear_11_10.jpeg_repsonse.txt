The comic book page features a sequence of six panels involving anthropomorphic bear characters and a smaller animal, possibly a raccoon or skunk, in various scenarios.

In the first panel, a large brown bear is climbing a tree, exclaiming "HEY! LOOK OUT!" in a speech bubble. The second panel shows the same bear, now hanging from the tree, with another bear and the small animal below him, saying "HERE WE ARE, POP---" and "-LIKE YOU SAID!" respectively. The setting appears to be outdoors, likely in a forested area.

The third panel depicts the small animal and the other bear in mid-air, with the small animal exclaiming "YIPPEE!" while the other bear grunts "UGH!" The fourth panel shows the bears on the ground, with the small animal still in the air, and the large bear saying "NOW REMEMBER NO MORE SHENANIGANS... GO TO SLEEP!" The small animal responds with "OKAY, POP!"

In the fifth panel, the large bear is lying down, appearing to be asleep, with the small animal next to him saying "LITTLE RASCALS - OH HUM!" The sixth panel shows the small animal and the other bear outside a house, with the small animal looking inside and the other bear peeking through a window, both seemingly observing something inside the house. The house has a clock on its side that reads "SPRING WINTER."

The overall interaction suggests a playful and mischievous dynamic between the characters, with the large bear acting as a parent figure trying to calm the smaller animals down after their antics.
