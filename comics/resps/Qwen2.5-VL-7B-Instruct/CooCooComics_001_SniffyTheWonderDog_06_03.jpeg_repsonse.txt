The comic book page opens with a scene inside what appears to be a pet store. A customer, dressed in a green coat and gray pants, is haggling over the price of a dog, which is humorously priced at ten cents per pound, totaling two dollars. The clerk, wearing a blue suit and a top hat, is hesitant but eventually agrees to sell the dog, noting that it might smother if not properly wrapped. The customer then asks about the dog's pedigree, to which the clerk responds with a playful exaggeration, claiming the dog has a real blue-blood lineage, including a mother who once gave a transfusion to a fountain pen.

The scene transitions to the customer leaving the store, exclaiming "Yippee! He's out of my life!!!", while the clerk, now holding the dog affectionately, says "Kitchy-Koo!" The customer rushes home, still holding the dog, and enters through the front door, instructing his wife to be nice to the dog since she hates dogs. Inside, the wife, dressed in a red and white striped dress, is seen talking to her son, who is holding an apple. The son, with curly brown hair, playfully says "Itchy-Koo... tiss momma!" while the wife looks on, seemingly amused by the situation. The final panel shows the dog, now inside the house, running towards the wife, who is sitting on the floor, with the caption "See? No animals... especially dogs!" The dog continues to run, and the wife, holding a bone, calls out "Apple!" indicating the dog's name and the source of its next treat.
