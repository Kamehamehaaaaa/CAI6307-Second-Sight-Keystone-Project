In the final panel, Finny Fish is shown lifting a large weight labeled "1000" pounds, while another character, Johnny, struggles with a smaller weight labeled "500" pounds. Finny Fish boasts, "Hi, FINNY! Look what JOHNNY'S LIFTIN' - A 1000 POUND DUMBBELL! 'Course, I can lift dat one wit' me pinky - I use a two-ton weight for my workouts!" This panel highlights Finny Fish's exaggerated strength, further emphasizing the comedic nature of the story.
