The comic book page opens with a whimsical scene where a group of seven dwarfs, dressed in their traditional green outfits and red caps, are gathered outdoors. One dwarf exclaims, "Look, fellow dopes! Prince Charming!" while another responds, "Who's th' lady -- I mean, witch!" This sets the tone for a humorous take on the classic fairy tale.

In the next panel, a character dressed as a witch, complete with a green hat and a wand, is seen interacting with a camel. The witch says, "Hullo, Prince Charming! Where you going with that beast and I don't mean the horse?" The camel, named "Wot," adds to the confusion by responding, "Wot!"

The narrative continues with the witch addressing the dwarfs, saying, "We have the real princess at our house! This phoney is a queen!" The dwarfs, now in a state of confusion, debate which is better: "Which is better?" one asks, while another suggests, "A princess like we have!"

The scene shifts to show the witch and the dwarfs in a room, with the witch declaring, "Okay, I'm coming. Bye, Queen!" The dwarfs, still unsure, exclaim, "Rats!" as they realize the witch has left.

The final panels depict the dwarfs inside a cozy cottage. One dwarf excitedly announces, "It's a Prince Charming!" while another retorts, "Shut my mouf!" The witch, now inside the cottage, declares, "Now he'll take her away... Goody!" The dwarfs, looking disheartened, gather around a table, with one saying, "Supper is ready!" Another responds, "Oh-oh! No... please." The witch, appearing unwell, excuses herself, saying, "Excuse me!"

The comic concludes with the dwarfs looking disappointed, as the text humorously states, "But the prince and sno use stayed with the seven dopes -- and they lived discontentedly ever after!" This playful twist on the classic story leaves the reader with a chuckle and a sense of the dwarfs' enduring dissatisfaction.
