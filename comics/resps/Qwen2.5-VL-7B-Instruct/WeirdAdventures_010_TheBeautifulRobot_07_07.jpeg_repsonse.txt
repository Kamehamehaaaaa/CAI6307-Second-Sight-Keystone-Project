The comic book page opens with a dramatic scene where a woman with blue hair is seen smashing a door, shouting "SMASH DOOR! KILL! KILL!" This intense moment sets the stage for an action-packed sequence. The next panel shows a man in a suit holding a woman in white, both looking distressed as they realize the door is crashing in. The urgency is palpable.

The narrative then shifts to a green robot, seemingly in distress, being struck by a fiery lightning bolt from the sky. The bolt crashes down, causing a high-tension wire to touch the robot, leading to a loud "EEEAAH!" as the robot is presumably damaged or destroyed. The setting appears to be an urban environment, possibly a city street, given the presence of a fire hydrant in the background.

In the following panels, the aftermath of the robot's destruction is revealed. A man in a suit and a woman in a black outfit are seen running away, appearing relieved but also concerned. The man exclaims, "...BUT A MESS OF..." while the woman responds, "...SCRAPS OF METAL!" The final panel provides a philosophical conclusion: "SHE WAS CREATED IN A BURST OF INSPIRATION... AND DESTROYED IN A BURST OF DESTRUCTIVE POWER -- BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN... THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITHOUT... THE BEAUTIFUL ROBOT!" The page concludes with "The End," leaving the reader with a sense of resolution and reflection on the events that transpired.
