The comic book page titled "Mysterious Treasure" opens with a serene sunset scene over the ocean, setting a tranquil yet adventurous tone. Two characters, Chad Billow, a young adventurer dressed in a yellow shirt and blue pants, and Kala, his Polynesian sidekick wearing green shorts, stand on a dock. Chad is speaking to Kala, saying, "Doggone good dinner, hey, Chad? Now me glad go 'board' Sea Hawk... Catch plenty sleep..." while Kala responds, "Kala--one of these days you'll bust your binnacle eatin' like that!" The backdrop includes a sailboat named "Sea Hawk," hinting at their upcoming journey.

The narrative shifts to a more intense scene where Chad and Kala are engaged in a physical altercation with two men on the deck of the "Sea Hawk." Chad exclaims, "Look, Chad! Two men... Fight up one man. He old man... We help him?" Kala replies, "We'll even up the forces anyway, kid, come on, but look sharp!" The action is dynamic, with Chad and Kala fighting off the attackers, showcasing their determination and teamwork amidst the chaos. The setting remains consistent with the dock and the "Sea Hawk," emphasizing the ongoing adventure and the challenges they face together.
