The comic book page opens with Private Pinto, dressed in his military uniform, greeting Lulu, who is outside the barracks. The dialogue box reads, "Gee, I'm glad to see you, Lulu!" Lulu responds with a cheerful "Hi ya!" as she waves at him. The scene shifts to show Private Pinto being reprimanded by a Sergeant, who sternly says, "Y-yes, Sarge? Your barracks didn't pass inspection. Go back and hit that dust!"

In the next panel, Private Pinto is depicted with a smug expression, thinking, "Now that was smart strategy! With that punk out of the way, I'll have the lady to myself." He then approaches Lulu, who is now inside the barracks, and asks, "Miss Lulu, I presume?" Lulu, looking surprised, asks, "Yesâ€”where did Private Joe go?"

The narrative continues with Private Pinto, now outside, addressing Lulu again, saying, "The private will be engaged in important military matters! May I escort you about the post instead?" Lulu, impressed, replies, "Why Sergeant, how kind of you! I'd be delighted!"

In the final panel, Private Pinto is seen walking away with Lulu, while Lulu thinks to herself, "This sergeant is even a bigger chump than that goofy private... my plans should go well." The background settings include the barracks and an outdoor area, indicating a military camp environment. The comic's tone is light-hearted, with a focus on the interactions between the characters and their humorous exchanges.
