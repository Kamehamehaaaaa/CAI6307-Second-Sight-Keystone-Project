The comic book page features a sequence of interactions between two anthropomorphic rabbits and a group of anthropomorphic bears in a watery environment, possibly a river or stream. The story begins with one rabbit, dressed in blue overalls, swimming towards a rock, declaring, "He'll never be able to reach this rock..." The scene shifts to show the rabbit reaching the rock, visibly exhausted, with a speech bubble saying, "Phew!" Another rabbit, also in blue overalls, appears, exclaiming, "Huh? Wot again?" This second rabbit seems confused or surprised by the first's actions.

The narrative progresses with the second rabbit asking, "What are you—twins?" while the first rabbit, now on the ground, responds with a distressed, "Gr-r-f A-r-g-h!" The setting changes to a darker, more ominous tone as the second rabbit is seen lying on the ground, seemingly injured or unconscious, with the first rabbit looking on in concern. The first rabbit then attempts to get back up, saying, "I'll get back to—Oh-oh!"

The final panels reveal the first rabbit being confronted by two large, menacing-looking bears. One bear asks, "What are you—twins?" with a question mark above their head, indicating confusion or disbelief. The other bear looks on with a stern expression. The first rabbit, now in a life jacket, cries out, "Mama!" suggesting they are searching for help or protection from the bears. The overall atmosphere of the page is tense, with the bears appearing threatening and the rabbits in various states of distress or urgency.
