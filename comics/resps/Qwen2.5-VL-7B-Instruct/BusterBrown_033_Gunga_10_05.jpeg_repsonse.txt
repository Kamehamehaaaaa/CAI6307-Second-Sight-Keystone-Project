The comic book page opens with a dialogue between three men in a lush, tropical setting, likely a banana grove. The first man, Gunga, is explaining his plan to the others, emphasizing the importance of not attempting a lone keddah (elephant capture) without proper preparation. He mentions that Hiralal's failure last year to rub his body with the leaves of the kulu bush to mask his scent led to his death when he tried capturing an elephant alone. The second man listens intently, while the third, Rama, suggests they wait for Tusker to call, believing it will bring them closer to the herd.

The scene shifts to show Tusker, a large elephant, being led by one of the men, presumably Rama, while Gunga and another man observe from a distance. Gunga instructs Tusker to remain quiet, and Rama agrees, suggesting they follow Tusker’s lead to approach the herd stealthily. They believe the elephants will mistake Tusker for one of their own.

In the next panel, Gunga spots Padmah, another elephant, but notes there are many elephants between him and her. He advises finding a kulu bush to hide his scent, while Rama remains skeptical about Gunga’s plan to capture Padmah alone. Gunga counters that the herd’s current formation gives him confidence he can secure the rope on Padmah’s leg, ensuring their success.

The page captures a tense moment of strategy and caution as the men navigate their plan amidst the dense jungle environment, highlighting the challenges and risks involved in their mission.
