The comic book page opens with a scene of a cat, visibly upset, exclaiming, "Who's smoking those rotten cigars?" The setting is indoors, with the cat looking at a lamp that has several lit candles hanging from it, emitting smoke. In the next panel, the cat, now on fire, yells, "Yeow! It's me! I'm on fire! Help!" The background shifts to green, indicating the cat's distress.

In the following panels, the cat, still on fire, runs frantically through what appears to be a workshop or garage, shouting, "Fire! Help!" A man, presumably the owner, rushes in, exclaiming, "My machine he's ruined!" He attempts to extinguish the flames but ends up spraying water, causing the cat to run away, still on fire, with the man chasing after him, saying, "Stop it!"

The final two panels show the cat, now outside, running towards a wooden fence. The cat, still in distress, exclaims, "Oof!" as it collides with the fence. The man追着猫跑，喊道，“I was never so embarrassed in my life! Lester, you're a disgrace!” The cat, now off-panel, is heard saying, “I’m a... Baaaad boy.” A young girl in a red dress runs towards the cat, seemingly concerned, adding a sense of urgency and humor to the chaotic scene.
