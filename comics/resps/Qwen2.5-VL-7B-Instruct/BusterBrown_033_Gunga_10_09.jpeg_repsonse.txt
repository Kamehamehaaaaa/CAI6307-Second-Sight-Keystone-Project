The comic book page depicts a dramatic scene involving two men and an elephant named Padmah. The setting is a lush, green jungle with dense foliage and trees, indicating a remote, wild environment. The first panel shows the two men, one wearing a red cloth around his waist and the other in green, working together to control Padmah using a rope. The man in red speaks, saying, "He has the rope on Padmah. Hold tightly, Rama!" The second panel captures the urgency of the situation as the man in green exclaims, "With all my strength." 

In the third panel, the men are seen pulling the rope, with the man in green saying, "Hold hard! We have her captured!" The fourth panel reveals the chaos that ensues when the herd of elephants, described as nearsighted and hard of hearing, senses danger nearby. The text reads, "The herd of elephants, nearsighted and hard of hearing, try to locate the danger they sense is near. But swift running Gunga is too fast."

The fifth panel shows panic as the herd stampedes, with the text stating, "Panic-stricken at the unknown fear, the wild herd stampedes! Padmah tries to follow..." The sixth panel illustrates the struggle between the men and Padmah, with the text, "...but her struggles are useless. The heavy Kedah rope holds Padmah fast."

In the final panel, the men continue their efforts to control Padmah, with the text reading, "We have captured her. She will receive her lesson, Gunga. Never fear. Keep the rope tight." The interaction between the men and Padmah highlights their determination and the challenges they face in managing the powerful animal amidst the chaotic jungle setting.
