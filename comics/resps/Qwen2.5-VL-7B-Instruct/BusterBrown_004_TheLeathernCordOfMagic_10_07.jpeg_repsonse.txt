The comic book page opens with a dialogue box where Jafara and Karim discuss their plan to disguise themselves as palace servants after cooking the strange fish from Lavender Lake. The setting is a vibrant, colorful room with a large sun in the background, suggesting a bright and lively atmosphere. Jafara, dressed in a striking red outfit, stands beside a table laden with food, while Karim, in a yellow ensemble, sits nearby. The dialogue reveals their urgency and the importance of their mission.

In the next panel, the focus shifts to the smell of the fish, which is described as making Jafara hungry. This scene captures a moment of tension and anticipation, hinting at the challenges they face. The background features a large, purple plant, adding an element of exoticism to the setting.

The narrative then transitions to a circular frame showing Myrrah, dressed in a blue and yellow outfit, tending to a man in bed. The man appears to be the caliph, and the interaction suggests a caring or protective role for Myrrah. The dialogue indicates that the caliph had a good night's sleep and is now ready to be up and about.

Finally, the last panel shows the caliph, now fully awake and dressed in a striped robe, sitting up in bed. A speech bubble from him expresses his satisfaction with the night's rest and readiness to start the day. The text at the bottom of the page concludes the story by stating that the strange meal progressed well, and the caliph was the last to finish his portion.

Throughout the page, the interactions between the characters highlight themes of disguise, urgency, care, and the completion of a task, all set against a vivid and detailed backdrop.
