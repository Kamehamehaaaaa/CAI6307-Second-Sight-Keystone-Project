The comic book page titled "The Kid Kangaroo" opens with a scene set in a lush, green forest. A kangaroo, presumably the titular "Kid Kangaroo," is depicted in a relaxed pose, leaning against a tree trunk with its eyes closed, suggesting it's asleep. The kangaroo's expression is serene, with a slight smile, and it is accompanied by a speech bubble that reads, "HO-HUM - MOM'S ASLEEP! GUESS I'LL HOP OUT AND SEE WOT'S COOKIN'..." This indicates the kangaroo is planning an adventure while its mother is resting.

The scene transitions to another part of the forest where a rabbit, dressed in a checkered outfit, is sitting on the ground, looking up at the sky with a contented expression. The rabbit exclaims, "AH! ALONE AT LAST! NOW FOR SOME ADVENTURE." This suggests the rabbit is excited about the prospect of solitude and the possibility of new experiences.

In the final panel, the rabbit encounters a large, dark figure that appears to be a lion. The rabbit, now visibly startled, exclaims, "HUH? DID I SAY ALONE!" The lion, with a surprised look, responds with "HM..." This interaction introduces an element of surprise and potential danger into the rabbit's otherwise adventurous plans, highlighting the unexpected nature of the forest's inhabitants.
