The comic book page features a series of interactions between a young girl and a playful dog named Lester Lamb. The setting alternates between an outdoor barn-like area and an indoor clothing store.

In the first panel, the girl, dressed in a red dress with a yellow bow, is outside near a wooden fence. She is speaking to Lester, who is sitting on the ground with his back against the fence. The dialogue reveals that Lester has been up to his usual tricks, and the girl is warning him that if he continues, she won't let him go with her anymore. The text reads: "LESTER LAMB! THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR TRICKS AND IF YOU DO ONE MORE TRICK LIKE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO WITH ME ANYMORE!"

The second panel shifts to the inside of a clothing store. The girl is now standing in front of a rack of clothes, looking at a green coat. She says, "I HAVE TO TRY ON MY NEW RED COAT FOR SIZE NEXT!" A woman, presumably the shopkeeper, is seen from behind, holding a piece of paper, possibly a receipt or a list of items.

In the third panel, the scene returns to the barn where Lester is now standing in front of a rack of clothes, looking at a pink coat. He exclaims, "WELL, IF IT ISN'T MY OLD FRIEND, LEM! I ALWAYS KNEW HE'D WIND UP THIS WAY!"

The fourth panel shows Lester trying on a red coat in the clothing store. The girl is pointing at the coat and saying, "THIS IS A QUANT NUMBER... I THINK I'LL TRY IT ON!"

In the fifth panel, the girl is now inside the clothing store, holding a piece of paper and talking to the shopkeeper. She says, "I KNOW YOU'LL LIKE THIS NUMBER... IT'S THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE LEFT! IT'S REDUCED TO NINETY-EIGHT DOLLARS!"

The final panel captures a humorous moment where Lester, now fully dressed in the red coat, is playfully interacting with the shopkeeper. The girl is laughing, and the shopkeeper is holding a piece of paper, possibly a receipt or a list. The text "EEK!" is drawn next to Lester, indicating his playful reaction to the situation.
