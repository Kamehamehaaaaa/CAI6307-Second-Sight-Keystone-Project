The comic book page features a humorous interaction between a rabbit and a lion in a jungle setting. The story begins with the rabbit, dressed in a red shirt and blue pants, approaching the lion who is sitting on the ground. The rabbit asks, "ER... AREN'T YOU MAKING A M-MISTAKE? SHOULDN'T Y-YOU BE OUT HUNTING T-TIGERS?" The lion, with a surprised expression, responds with "NO?" and then says, "EXCUSE ME." The scene shifts to show the lion, now in a close-up, looking confused or surprised.

In the next panel, the rabbit is seen climbing a tree, exclaiming, "WHW!" and then saying, "SAFE AT LAST!" The rabbit looks relieved as they climb higher. The lion, still below, comments, "GOOD THING THAT LION CAN'T CLIMB A TREE--" indicating that the lion is unable to follow the rabbit into the tree.

The narrative continues with the lion, now in a close-up, looking frustrated and shouting, "AARGH!" The rabbit, perched high up in the tree, looks down with a smug expression. The lion, still below, says, "LIONS CAN'T SWIM -- I HOPE..." The final panel shows the lion, now in the water, struggling to swim while the rabbit, still in the tree, looks down with a triumphant "OOF!"

Throughout the comic, the characters' expressions and dialogue convey a playful and exaggerated dynamic, typical of classic cartoon humor. The jungle setting provides a backdrop for the chase and the rabbit's clever escape, emphasizing the comedic contrast between the rabbit's agility and the lion's inability to climb trees or swim effectively.
