The comic book page opens with a dramatic scene where a woman in a yellow blouse and red skirt is seen shouting "I'LL KILL YOU, ANNA!" and "NO! NO! YOUR OWN SISTER--!" as she confronts a group of men on a rooftop. The tension escalates as the woman demands the men drop their guns, exclaiming "DROP THOSE GUNS, YOU GUYS! DROP 'EM!" The setting is a cityscape under a cloudy sky, suggesting an urban environment.

In the next panel, the confrontation reaches its peak as the woman is shot at by police officers. The dialogue reveals urgency: "COPS! BLAST 'EM--OHHHH!" and "LET 'EM HAVE IT, PETE!" The police, dressed in blue uniforms, are depicted aiming their weapons, adding to the chaos.

The narrative shifts to a more hopeful tone as the woman pleads for help, saying "THE MACHINE!! SAVE THE MACHINE!!" while the police officer responds, "NO USE! THOSE TWO GUYS AND THAT GADGET ARE GONE FOR GOOD!" This indicates that the machine they were protecting has been destroyed.

The scene changes to show a man in a blue uniform falling from a building, exclaiming "HEY! A BREEZE! BOY, SMELL THAT FRESH AIR!" as he falls. The dialogue continues with "BUT AT THAT MOMENT--!" and "OH, LARS--LARS! IT'S ALL OVER!" suggesting a moment of realization or despair.

Several days later, the story takes a reflective turn. In a hospital room, a doctor informs Lars, who is lying in bed with a bandaged head, that he will be fine. The doctor adds, "THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'LL BE FINE, LARS! AND THE POLICE WON'T ARREST US... THEY SAY YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE TO SAVE THE CITY, AND--" The dialogue implies that Lars has made a significant sacrifice.

The final panel shows Lars in conversation with a woman in a red coat, who says, "IF MR. KEMAL COULD MAKE SUCH A MACHINE... PERHAPS SOMEONE ELSE CAN, LARS? AND THEN IT WILL BE USED FOR GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL!" This suggests a broader context of good versus evil and the potential for change through innovation.

The page concludes with the caption "THE END," marking the resolution of the conflict and the hope for future
