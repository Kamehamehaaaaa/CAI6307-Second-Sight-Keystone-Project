The comic book page features a bear character engaging in a humorous winter activity. The bear, dressed in a blue scarf and mittens, is initially seen running through the snow with a determined expression, exclaiming "AHA! SO THAT'S IT!" in the first panel. In the second panel, the bear trips over a log, causing a "WHAM!" sound effect as he falls onto his back, still clutching his mitten. 

In the third panel, the bear is shown lying on the ground, clutching his leg in pain, with a speech bubble saying "YEE-OWWW!" indicating his distress. The fourth panel shows the bear sitting up, bandaged and looking frustrated, saying, "THAT DOES IT. NOW TO SLEEP TO SPRING!"

The fifth panel depicts the bear inside a tent, groaning and saying "GARR-GH!" while chopping wood with an axe, indicated by the "CHOP CHOP!" text. In the final panel, the bear continues chopping wood, now saying "NOW WHAT--" followed by "CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP!" suggesting he's determined to keep going despite the pain.

The comic uses exaggerated expressions and sound effects to convey the bear's struggle and determination, creating a comedic narrative of a bear trying to chop wood in the snow.
