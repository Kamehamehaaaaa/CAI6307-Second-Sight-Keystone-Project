The comic book page features a whimsical scene involving anthropomorphic animal characters. In the first panel, a cat named Catsup is being playfully taunted by a squirrel character who exclaims, "Catsup (chic!) She's not a bad tomato!" The setting appears to be a stage or performance area, indicated by the red curtains and the presence of an audience.

In the second panel, the squirrel, now dressed in a magician's outfit with a top hat and wand, addresses the audience, saying, "As soon as the coffin is completely sealed, I shall proceed!" This suggests that the squirrel is performing a magic trick involving a green coffin. The audience, consisting of various animals including a pig, a dog, and a rabbit, watches intently.

The third panel shows the squirrel, still in his magician's attire, holding a saw and declaring, "Music Maestro!" This implies that he is about to cut into the coffin while playing music, adding a humorous twist to the magic act. The audience remains captivated, with musical notes floating around them, indicating the music being played.

In the final panel, the squirrel, now wearing a wizard's hat, is seen cutting into the coffin with a determined expression. He says, "I hope Miss Catsup won't be sore when I finish!" This suggests that the squirrel intends to cut the coffin open after the performance, possibly to reveal something unexpected or humorous.

Throughout the page, the interactions between the characters are light-hearted and comedic, with the squirrel's antics being the central focus. The setting and dialogue contribute to a playful and entertaining narrative.
