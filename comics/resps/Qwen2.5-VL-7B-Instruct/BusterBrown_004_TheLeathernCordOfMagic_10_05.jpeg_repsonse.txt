The comic book page depicts a dramatic scene set within the chambers of a sleeping caliph, where Myrrah, Jafarra, and Karim are hiding behind heavy drapes. The setting is richly detailed with ornate furniture and vibrant colors, suggesting a luxurious palace interior. The dialogue reveals that the caliph's wazir, Bele Kahr, the magician, has prepared a mixture of slow poison. Myrrah and Karim are concerned about what they can do to prevent the wazir from giving the poison to their father.

In the next panel, Bele Kahr is seen dropping the glass of poison, revealing his spell has been broken. He exclaims, "You! Freed from the spell! But you were a fool to come here!"

The urgency escalates as guards are heard approaching, prompting Karim to shout, "GUARDS!" and urge Karim to escape through the window and climb to the roof for safety.

The final panel shows Karim running towards the window, with guards visible in the background, emphasizing the perilous nature of their escape. The urgency and danger are palpable as the characters navigate the perilous situation, highlighting themes of betrayal, survival, and the consequences of magic and power.
