The comic book page opens with a scene inside "Teddie's Dress Shop," where a small girl and her dog are having a heated argument. The girl, wearing a yellow dress and a red bow, is visibly upset, exclaiming, "Of all the horrid stunts! We can do very well without you and that beast that follows you!" Her dog, a fluffy white poodle, sits beside her, looking equally frustrated.

The scene transitions to the shop's counter, where the girl is now speaking to an older man behind the counter. He is bald, wearing glasses, and dressed in a blue shirt. She asks him for groceries: "Give me a pound of butter... a pound of sugar... a loaf of bread and a can of vegetable soup!" The man nods, seemingly understanding her request.

Next, the girl is shown searching for the canned soup in a dimly lit storage area. The man, now leaning against the wall, watches her with a concerned expression. She calls out, "Let's now, where do we keep the canned soup?" The man responds, "Here they are!" but she quickly adds, "No! No! Don't take the bottom one!"

The final panel shows the girl outside, running away from the store with her dog. The dog, still white and fluffy, looks back at her with a worried expression. The girl, now in a hurry, exclaims, "And so... now, everywhere that Mary Stray, the lamb, you guessed, he stays!" The background reveals a barn-like structure, indicating they have left the town or village setting.

The comic captures a moment of conflict between the girl and her dog, followed by a resolution where the dog remains with her, highlighting themes of loyalty and companionship.
