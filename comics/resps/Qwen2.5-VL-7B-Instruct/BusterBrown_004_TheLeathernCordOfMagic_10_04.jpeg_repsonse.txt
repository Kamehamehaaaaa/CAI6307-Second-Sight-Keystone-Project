The comic book page opens with a scene where a character, presumably Jinn, is seen commanding another character, Jafara, to transform into a tiny mouse. The setting appears to be outdoors, with trees and a pathway visible, suggesting a garden or park-like environment. The dialogue box reads, "OH JINN... I COMMAND YOU TO BECOME A TINY MOUSE!"

In the next panel, Jafara and Karim are depicted sneaking over a wall and into the shrubbery to attract Myrrah's attention as she passes on the walk. The background shows a lush green area with trees and bushes, indicating they are in a secluded part of the garden.

The following panels shift to an indoor setting, likely a palace or a wealthy household. A woman, presumably Myrrah, is engaged in conversation with two other women. One of them, wearing a headdress, expresses concern about a wise saying for a little boy, implying that Myrrah must share her experiences while under a spell. The dialogue reads, "A WOMAN WILL FACE A LION... BUT NEVER A MOUSE!" and "A WISE SAYING FOR A LITTLE BOY, BUT COME NOW, MYRRAH MUST TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS UNDER THE SPELL..."

In the final panels, the focus shifts to a man named Bele Kahr, who is described as cruel, wicked, and jealous of Myrrah's father's wealth and power. He instructs Myrrah to guide them secretly to her father's chambers so they may see something of interest. The setting here is more ornate, with intricate designs and luxurious furnishings, emphasizing the opulence of the environment. The dialogue reads, "MY FATHER IS VERY ILL! NO PHYSICIAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CURE HIM... HE IS ATTENDED ONLY BY HIS WAZIR, BELE KAHR!" and "BELE KAHR IS CRUEL, WICKED, AND JEALOUS OF YOUR FATHER'S WEALTH AND POWER. TONIGHT, MYRRAH, GUIDE US SECRETLY TO YOUR FATHER'S CHAMBERS... WE MAY SEE SOMETHING OF INTEREST!"

The narrative flows from an outdoor garden scene to an indoor palace setting, highlighting themes of magic, intrigue, and familial conflict.
