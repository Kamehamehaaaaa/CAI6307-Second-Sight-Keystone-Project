The comic book page opens with a man in a red coat and hat, identified as David Brant, speaking to another man who is parking his car in front of an apartment building. The dialogue reveals that the man in the red coat is confused about the location, suggesting he might be mistaken about where he lives. The scene shifts to show the man in the red coat rushing past a doorman into an apartment building, where he discovers no apartment listed for David Brant. This leads him to believe he's experiencing a bizarre nightmare.

The narrative then transitions to a woman named Peggy, who is inside the apartment, expressing concern over her presence there the night before their wedding. She is interrupted by a man in a blue suit, who reveals that David Brant gave him a strange drink, causing him to have a vivid dream. The man in the blue suit explains that David was killed in an accident last year during a hunting trip, which he had been looking forward to with Peggy. He confesses to being overexcited and unable to explain the time paradox he experienced, deciding instead to write it down as one of lifeâ€™s inexplicable twists.

The final panel shows the man in the blue suit apologizing to Peggy, explaining that David was such a dear friend but that the accident couldn't be helped. He acknowledges that she missed saving him by the barest second, leaving the reader with a sense of unresolved mystery and emotional depth.
