The comic book page features a whimsical tale involving anthropomorphic flies. The story begins with a group of flies, led by one with a mischievous grin, approaching a large cloud. One fly warns, "Take it easy! It may be a trap!" The flies then land on a sign that reads "Fly's Rest," indicating a place for rest. However, the flies soon realize they've made a mistake; the ground is covered in a sticky substance, trapping them. One fly exclaims, "Er-sticky stuff! I can't move!" while another cries out, "We all stuck!"

The scene shifts to show the flies trapped in the sticky substance, with signs around them reading "Special Accommodations." A fly, seemingly the leader, declares, "O.K., men! We've got 'em!" Another fly laments, "And we can't even make suicide for Emperor!" The flies' predicament is further emphasized when one fly says, "Woe is me!"

In the final panel, a character dressed as an emperor, complete with a crown and cape, stands triumphantly. He holds up a scroll and proclaims, "We'll consign them to a watery grave!" The flies, now in a line, look dejected, with one saying, "Boo-hoo!" The emperor's victory is evident as he surveys his conquest, while the flies' plight is highlighted through their expressions and dialogue.

The comic uses exaggerated expressions and dialogue to convey the humor and absurdity of the situation, making it clear that the flies have been tricked into landing in a sticky trap, leading to their comical predicament.
