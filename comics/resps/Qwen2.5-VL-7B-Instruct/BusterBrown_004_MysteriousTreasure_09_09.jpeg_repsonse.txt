The comic book page opens with a scene set in what appears to be a rustic cabin or hut, where two men are engaged in a conversation. One man, shirtless and wearing blue pants, is speaking animatedly about the smell of ambergris, a substance given off by sick sperm whales and highly valued for its use in fine perfumes. The other man, dressed in a yellow shirt and blue pants, listens intently, nodding his head in agreement. The dialogue reveals that they have been tracking the scent of ambergris for some time, and now they believe they have found it.

The narrative continues with the two men searching through the cabin, sniffing around to locate the strongest scent. They eventually discover a small amount of ambergris, which one of them excitedly identifies as their treasure. The text explains that ambergris is a rare substance, making the discovery significant. The value of ambergris is further emphasized when another character, Kala, enters the scene, expressing his excitement over the find.

The final panel shows Kala, now lying on a bed, reflecting on the potential wealth from their discovery. He speaks about how this could be a rich business and suggests that if they become poor again, they might need to hunt more ambergris. The interaction between the characters highlights their camaraderie and shared enthusiasm for the prospect of financial gain from their find. The setting remains consistent throughout the page, maintaining a focus on the cabin and the characters' expressions and actions.
