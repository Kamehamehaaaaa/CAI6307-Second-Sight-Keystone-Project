The comic book page features a humorous winter scene involving several anthropomorphic characters. In the first panel, a frog character named Smilin' Ed is being encouraged by a mouse character to start skiing. The mouse says, "Smilin' Ed can't get started, so I'll just give him a little shove!" Smilin' Ed, wearing a red hat and green outfit, is being pushed forward by the mouse.

In the second panel, Smilin' Ed is seen mid-air after being pushed, with the word "HALP!" indicating his distress. The background shows a snowy landscape with trees and a mountain range, suggesting a cold, wintry setting.

The third panel captures Smilin' Ed falling onto a wooden fence, with the word "OH-H-H-H-H-H-H-H!" expressing his pain or surprise. The fence is part of a house with a flag, adding a touch of domesticity to the otherwise adventurous scene.

In the final panel, Smilin' Ed is lying on the ground, looking distressed, while a mouse character and a cat character stand nearby. The mouse says, "My gootness, I don't know whether I like Smilin' Ed's new shape or not!" The cat character responds, "I think Smilin' Ed likes winter sports, I do, I do!" This dialogue suggests that Smilin' Ed has undergone some physical transformation due to the skiing mishap. The scene concludes with an ambulance in the background, humorously implying that Smilin' Ed might need medical attention for his injuries.

The comic strip is signed at the bottom with the names of the characters: Squeekie the Mouse, Midnight the Cat, Fingry the Gremlin, and Grandy the Piane. It is copyrighted in 1946 by Smilin' Ed McConnell and stories by Hobart Donavan.
