The comic book page features a dialogue between a father and his son, Allie, set in a cozy living room with a window, curtains, and a couch. The father, dressed in a suit and tie, is sternly addressing Allie, who is wearing a blue shirt and green pants. The father begins by questioning Allie about throwing spitballs, referencing a letter from the teacher. Allie admits to the truth, emphasizing the importance of honesty.

In the second panel, the father explains the dangers of throwing spitballs, pointing out that it spreads germs. Allie listens intently, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The father then shows Allie his mouth, which is visibly full of germs, reinforcing the point about hygiene and health risks.

In the fourth panel, the father asks Allie if he will promise not to throw any more spitballs. Allie agrees but adds a condition: he will wash his mouth first. The final panel captures Allie's reluctant acceptance, with him raising his hands in a gesture of surrender, saying "I give up!" The father looks exasperated yet understanding, indicating a moment of compromise and education.
