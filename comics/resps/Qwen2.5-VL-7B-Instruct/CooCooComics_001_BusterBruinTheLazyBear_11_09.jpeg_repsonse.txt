The comic book page features a sequence of interactions between anthropomorphic bear characters and a bird, set against a backdrop of a cliffside. The story begins with two bears, one in blue overalls and the other in an orange outfit, calling out "Hi, Pop!" and "Where's he going?" as they watch a larger bear in an orange shirt climb down a steep cliff face. The larger bear is humorously referred to as a "squab" by the smaller bears, leading to a playful scuffle involving the bird, who joins in the fray, calling out "Hey! Cut it out, you squab!" and "He called Pop a squab!"

The bird then declares, "I'll fix him!" and proceeds to engage in a comical fight with the larger bear, who is now on the ground. The bear responds with "Yow! Halp!" as the bird continues to attack. The scene shifts to show the bear being saved by the bird, who exclaims "Gulp! Saved!" and "Crunch!" as the bear is lifted back up.

In the final panels, the bear, now back on the cliff, calls out to the smaller bears, "You kids better come down offa there!" The smaller bears respond with "Okay, Pop----" and "Here we come!" as they prepare to descend the cliff themselves. The entire sequence is filled with exaggerated expressions and dynamic poses, typical of classic comic book art, creating a humorous and lively narrative.
