The comic book page titled "Dome of Death" opens with a dramatic scene of a city under siege. The sky is filled with planes, some of which are firing at a massive, transparent dome that looms over the cityscape. The dome, labeled as the "Dome of Death," is depicted as a formidable barrier, with beams of light emanating from its surface, suggesting it's a powerful force. Below, military vehicles, including tanks and artillery, are positioned on the ground, ready for action. Explosions and smoke billow from the base of the dome, indicating ongoing conflict.

The narrative shifts to introduce "Swede" Swenson, an ordinary man who becomes extraordinary when the fate of the city rests on his shoulders. The first panel shows him standing in front of the Arrow Building, the tallest structure in Midwest City, expressing admiration for its beauty. The building is described as a symbol of pride for Swede, who is the chief janitor there. Inside his home, Swede is seen interacting with his family—a wife who loves him and two adorable children. The dialogue reveals a domestic life marked by love and familial bonds, contrasting sharply with the chaos outside.

The story continues with Swede's brother-in-law, Joe, who is portrayed as a source of tension within the family. Joe's presence is indicated through a series of panels showing him eating in Swede’s house, sleeping in his bed, and making threats about taking over Swede's responsibilities. This interaction highlights the strain between family members during times of crisis, adding depth to the narrative.

Overall, the page captures a moment of high tension and personal struggle, juxtaposing the grand scale of the city's threat with the intimate lives of its inhabitants.
