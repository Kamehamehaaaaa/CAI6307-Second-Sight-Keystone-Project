The comic book page opens with a scene where a small dog, labeled "PUPPY," is playfully interacting with two men. The dog, with a mischievous expression, barks "WOOF!" while one man, wearing a striped shirt, exclaims "YEE-OWW!!" in pain, indicating the dog has bitten him. The other man, also in a striped shirt, responds with "SNAP!" suggesting he's about to retaliate.

In the next panel, the two men kneel on the floor, holding the dog gently. The man in the blue shirt pleads, "GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE, DEAR--AFTER ALL WE DO NEED A WATCH-DOG!" while the other man, now in a red and white striped outfit, agrees, "WATCH-DOG!"

The scene shifts to a different setting where an older man, dressed in a sailor suit, is sitting on a chair, talking to the puppy. He says, "GOOD NIGHT, PUPPY... BE A GOOD WATCH-DOG AND EAT UP ALL THE BURGLARS! REMEMBER--YOU'RE IN CHARGE DOWN HERE!" The puppy, with a determined look, repeats "ARF!" three times, showing its readiness.

The next panel shows the puppy lying on the floor, looking up at a figure entering through a window. The caption reads, "LATER THAT NIGHT..."

The final panels depict a burglar, dressed in a brown coat and hat, sneaking into the house. The puppy, now standing alert, greets the burglar with "ARF!" The burglar, surprised, exclaims, "WELL, WELL---A WATCH-DOG! AND HE'S GLAD TO SEE ME!! HI'YA, PUP!!" The puppy, seemingly proud, responds with "ARF!"

In the last panel, the burglar looks confused, saying, "WELL, WHADDAYA KNOW---TRICKS HE'S SHOWING ME!" The scene ends with the burglar looking puzzled, highlighting the puppy's unexpected ability to recognize and interact with the burglar.
