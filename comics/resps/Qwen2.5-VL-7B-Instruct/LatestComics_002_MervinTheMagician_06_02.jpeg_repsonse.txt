The comic book page features a lively scene set within a circus or theatrical performance. The main character, a lion dressed as a wizard, is the central figure, engaging with various animal characters. The lion, adorned in a red wizard's hat and cape, introduces himself with a confident statement, "Too bad we can't give some of this corn to our allies! Well folks let's get on with the show!" This sets the stage for a magical act.

In the first panel, the lion gestures towards a young girl, declaring, "I'll now perform a feat of magic which I learned on my trip to India! I'm going to make this beautiful girl vanish!" The audience, consisting of other animals like a wolf, a pig, and a donkey, watches eagerly. The pig exclaims, "How wonderful! Terrific!" while the wolf responds, "He can't do that!"

The next panels depict the lion waving his magic cape in front of the girl, who is seated on a stool. The audience's expressions shift from excitement to surprise as the girl vanishes. The wolf, in particular, expresses disbelief, saying, "She has disappeared! The gods of India have taken her away! But she'll be backâ€”she has to be, we have another show tonight!"

The final panel shows the lion, now in a panic, running off stage with the cape trailing behind him. He exclaims, "Ciao!!" as he dashes away, leaving the audience in shock and confusion. The overall setting is vibrant and colorful, typical of a classic comic book style, with bold lines and expressive characters. The interaction between the lion and the audience, along with the magical disappearance of the girl, creates a humorous and engaging narrative.
