The comic book page opens with a character, dressed in a checkered outfit, calling out "MAMA-AH!" in a distressed manner, indicating they have noticed something amiss. The next panel shows the same character, now in a more dynamic pose, exclaiming "GONE!" as if something or someone has vanished. The following panel captures a swift movement, with the character saying "SOUNDS LIKE MY KIDS IN TROUBLE!" suggesting concern for their offspring.

The scene shifts to a group of anthropomorphic lions, who appear to be the source of the commotion. One lion is seen with a hand on their head, asking "WOT'S GON' ON?" while another exclaims "GOODNESS LIONS!" The central lion, with a worried expression, declares, "MAMA—THESE GEN'LE'MEN ARE MOLESTIN' ME!" This indicates that the lions are being harassed by the unseen children.

In the next panel, the mother character, still in her checkered outfit, is shown reacting to the situation. She says, "OH, THEY ARE—ARE THEY!" as she notices the lions. The lions, now in a defensive stance, are depicted with expressions of surprise and fear. The mother character then delivers a powerful punch, sending one lion flying back with the sound effects "BIFF" and "POW!"

The following panels show the aftermath of the confrontation. The mother character, now satisfied, comments, "GEE, MOM--YOU SURE FIXED THOSE OL' LIONS!" while the other character responds, "I DID? LIONS! Ooooh!" The mother character then turns to the other character, saying, "I GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOUR POLICH, HUH?" The final panel shows the mother character, now relaxed and content, with a question mark above her head, suggesting she might be pondering the situation or the outcome of her actions.
