The comic book page opens with a tense scene aboard a ship where a group of men, including a man in a brown suit and another in a striped shirt, are engaged in a heated conversation. The dialogue box reads, "Okay, Billow! You asked for it! Now you're gonna get it..." indicating a confrontation or a challenge. The setting shifts to the deck of the ship where guards, unaware of Kala and the Polynesians, are seen. The text explains, "On deck, the guards are unaware of Kala and the Polynesians as they climb aboard..."

The narrative progresses to show Kala and his friends taking over the ship named "Swift." The text states, "With hardly an effort, Kala and his friends take over the 'Swift.' They quickly free Chad, who is somewhat the worse for wear..." This indicates that Kala and his companions have successfully taken control of the ship and are aiding Chad, who appears to be in need of assistance.

In the next panel, we see Chad receiving help from Kala. The text reads, "Drink this, Chad! You feel better!" Kala offers a drink to Chad, suggesting he is feeling unwell. The interaction between the two highlights their camaraderie and the urgency of the situation.

The final panel shows Chad, Kala, and the chief inspecting the ship from bow to stern. The text concludes, "And the next day, their enemies trussed and out of the way, Chad, Kala, and the chief go over the 'Island Queen' from bow to stern...and wind up as puzzled as before!" This suggests that despite their efforts, the ship's condition remains unchanged, adding a layer of mystery or perhaps a twist to the story. The characters' expressions and body language convey a mix of determination and concern, reflecting the ongoing challenges they face.
