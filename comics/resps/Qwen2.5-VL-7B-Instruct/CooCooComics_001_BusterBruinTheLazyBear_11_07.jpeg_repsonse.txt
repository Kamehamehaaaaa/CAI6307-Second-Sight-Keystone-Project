The comic book page features a series of six panels involving anthropomorphic bear characters in a forest setting. The first panel shows two bears, one with a blue outfit and the other with an orange outfit, excitedly exclaiming "C'MON, JASPER - POP'S ASLEEP!" and "OH, BOY!" suggesting they are planning something mischievous while their father is asleep. In the second panel, the same two bears are seen running up a steep cliffside, with the bear in the blue outfit saying "I KNOW--" and the bear in the orange outfit responding with "EAGLES' EGGS!" indicating their plan involves stealing eggs from eagles.

In the third panel, the bear in the orange outfit asks "HUUH?" looking confused or surprised. The fourth panel introduces a larger bear, presumably the father, who is dressed in a red outfit and is running towards the two smaller bears, exclaiming "GOODNESS--WHERE ARE THE KIDS?" This suggests he has noticed his children's absence and is concerned about their whereabouts. 

The fifth panel shows the father bear, now lying on the ground, calling out "YOO-HOO! JASPER! WILBUR!" in an attempt to locate his missing children. The final panel depicts the father bear climbing a tree, with the thought bubble above him reading "OMIGOSH ---- I BET THEY'RE OUT CLIMBING TREES!" This indicates that he suspects his children might have climbed into the trees, possibly to avoid being found by him. The overall tone of the comic is light-hearted and humorous, with the characters engaging in playful antics and misunderstandings.
