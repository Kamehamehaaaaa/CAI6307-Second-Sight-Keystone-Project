The comic book page titled "Lester Lamb" opens with a scene outside a butcher shop. A young girl named Mary is seen entering the shop, holding a piece of paper. A lamb, presumably Lester, is running towards her from the opposite direction. The sign on the butcher shop window reads, "Butcher Shop Special Today Lamb Chops." In the first panel, Mary exclaims, "Nix, Mary!! I'll follow you anywhere but not in THERE!" This indicates her reluctance to enter the shop.

The second panel shows Mary inside the shop, looking at the paper she's holding. She says, "Gee I'm glad mommy wrote these things down! I'd never remember all of them!" This suggests that the paper contains important information or instructions. The lamb, now inside the shop, asks, "Can't I go with you Mary huh? Can I, huh?" Mary responds, "All right! But you must promise to behave this time!" The lamb replies, "Who? ME?" This exchange highlights the lamb's confusion about being included in the plan.

In the final panel, Mary and the lamb are outside again, with Mary holding the paper. The lamb seems to have forgotten his promise to behave, as he is running away. The background includes a house and some trees, indicating they are back in the yard. The overall interaction between Mary and Lester is playful yet slightly mischievous, as the lamb tries to tag along despite Mary's initial reluctance.
