The comic book page is a vibrant display of a whimsical world, filled with characters and settings that are both fantastical and familiar. The page is divided into six panels, each telling a part of the story.

In the first panel, we see a character named Blinky, who is described as a little girl with blonde hair. She is standing in front of a sign that reads "If you wish to turn back, look! Someone is coming this way—and in a hurry too!" This suggests that Blinky is at a crossroads, possibly deciding whether to continue on her journey or turn back.

The second panel introduces us to another character, a green frog named Froggy. He is standing next to a sign that reads "If you wish to turn back, look!
