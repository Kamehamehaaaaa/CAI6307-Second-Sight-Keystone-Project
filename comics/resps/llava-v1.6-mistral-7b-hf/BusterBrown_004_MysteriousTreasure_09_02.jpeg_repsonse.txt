The comic page is a dynamic sequence of panels, each telling a part of the story. The narrative unfolds as follows:

In the first panel, we see a group of men in a hospital room. One man, presumably the captain, is lying in bed, while another man, possibly a doctor, is standing by his side. The captain is holding a cup, suggesting he might be in pain or discomfort.

The second panel shifts the scene to a ship. The captain is now standing on the deck of the ship, which is sailing on the ocean. He is looking out at the horizon, perhaps contemplating his journey or the events that led him to this point.

In the third panel, the captain is seen in a different setting, this time in a room with a large window. He is now accompanied by a woman, who is holding a baby. The captain seems to be in a state of distress, possibly due to the baby's condition.

The fourth panel returns to the hospital room. The captain is now lying in bed, with the woman and the baby by his side. The doctor is standing by, observing the situation. The captain's expression is one of concern, indicating that the baby's condition is critical.

The final panel shows the captain in a different room, this time with a group of men. The men are holding guns, suggesting a tense or dangerous situation. The captain's expression is one of determination, indicating that he is prepared to face whatever challenges come his way.

Throughout the comic, the text provides additional context to the narrative. For example, in the first panel, the doctor says, "And when the two were through...", suggesting that the captain has just been through a difficult ordeal. In the second panel, the captain says, "We really gonna go through with this?", indicating that he is hesitant or uncertain about the journey ahead. In the third panel, the woman says, "I'm not gonna let you die!", showing her determination to save the captain's life. In the fourth panel, the doctor says, "The old man's gonna be all right...", suggesting that he is optimistic about the captain's recovery. I
