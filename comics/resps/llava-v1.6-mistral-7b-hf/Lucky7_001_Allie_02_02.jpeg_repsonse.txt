The comic book page is a lively display of a young boy named Allie and his father, who is a detective. The setting is a park, with a tree and a house visible in the background.

The comic begins with Allie running towards his father, who is standing on the sidewalk. Allie is excitedly asking his father why he's chasing girls. The father responds with a stern warning, telling Allie that he should not tease girls.

In the next panel, Allie is seen chasing a girl, much to his father's disapproval. The father, now in a car, is seen driving away from the park, presumably to stop Allie from his mischievous behavior.

The comic continues with Allie and his father in a car, where Allie is still trying to tease the girl. The father, now in a more serious tone, tells Allie that he was just teasing and that he should not do it again.

The final panel of the comic shows Allie and his father back at the park. Allie is now holding the girl's hand, and the father is seen shaking hands with her. The comic ends with the father telling Allie that he was proud of him for learning his lesson.

Throughout the comic, the interaction between Allie and his father is the main focus. The father's stern warnings and the son's mischievous behavior create a humorous and relatable narrative. The comic effectively uses visual cues and dialogue to convey the story.
