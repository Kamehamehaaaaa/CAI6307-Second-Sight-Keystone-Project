The comic book page is a dynamic display of adventure and camaraderie. It's divided into four panels, each telling a part of the story.

In the first panel, we see a group of people in a jungle setting. They are armed with spears, suggesting they are on a hunting expedition. The text "Me has the rope tied tightly, Rama!" indicates that one of the characters is ensuring the safety of another, named Rama.

The second panel shifts the scene to a more dangerous encounter. The group is now facing a herd of elephants. The text "Hold hard! We are captured!" suggests that the group is in a precarious situation, possibly having been caught by the elephants.

The third panel continues the narrative of the group's struggle. The text "Good work, hero! Stampede the elephants!" implies that one of the characters is commending another for their bravery.

The fourth and final panel shows the aftermath of the encounter. The text "But her struggles are useless, the heavy Kedarn rope holds Rama fast." indicates that despite their efforts, the group is unable to free Rama from the elephants' grasp.

Throughout the comic, the characters are depicted in various states of action and emotion, from the initial preparation for the hunt to the intense struggle with the elephants. The text provides additional context to the visual narrative, adding depth to the characters' motivations and the unfolding events.
