The comic page is a vibrant display of adventure and camaraderie. It's divided into three distinct panels, each telling a part of the story.

In the first panel, we see a man in a blue shirt and a blue hat, who is the main character of the story. He's swimming in the ocean, with a sense of urgency as he's trying to reach a boat. He's shouting, "Meanwhile, on the swift!" which suggests that he's in a hurry to get to the boat.

The second panel takes us to a beach scene. The main character is now on the beach, and he's talking to a man in a yellow shirt. The man in yellow is saying, "Okay, Billow, what the 'Island Queen' is doing where it is?" This indicates that the main character is trying to find out about the 'Island Queen', possibly a boat or a ship.

The third and final panel is a bit more action-packed. The main character is now in the water, swimming towards a group of men on a boat. He's shouting, "They go long boat swift! Mostly under water! We climb! Catch 'em bad man!" This suggests that the main character is trying to board the boat, possibly to confront the men on board.

Throughout the comic, the main character is depicted as a man of action, determined to reach his destination and uncover the mystery of the 'Island Queen'. The text and images together create a narrative of adventure and intrigue.
