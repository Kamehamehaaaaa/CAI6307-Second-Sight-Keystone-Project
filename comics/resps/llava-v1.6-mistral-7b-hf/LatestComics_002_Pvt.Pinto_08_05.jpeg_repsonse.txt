The comic book page is a dynamic collage of four panels, each telling a part of a story. The setting is a field, where a group of people are gathered around a large, metallic object.

In the first panel, a man in a military uniform is seen pointing at the object, explaining its purpose. He seems to be the leader of the group, given his authoritative stance and the attention he's receiving.

The second panel introduces a woman, who is seen running towards the object. Her actions suggest a sense of urgency or excitement.

The third panel shows the same man from the first panel, now in a different pose. He appears to be in a state of surprise or shock, possibly reacting to the woman's actions or the object itself.

The fourth and final panel reveals the object to be a large telescope. The man and woman are now standing in front of it, their expressions suggesting awe or curiosity. The text in the comic book page confirms this, with phrases like "That's why I brought you here" and "It's an enemy way let me at that gun!" indicating a narrative of discovery and potential conflict.

Throughout the comic book page, the characters' actions and expressions, along with the text, create a narrative of discovery, surprise, and potential conflict. The setting, the characters, and their interactions all contribute to this narrative, making the comic book page a compelling piece of storytelling.
