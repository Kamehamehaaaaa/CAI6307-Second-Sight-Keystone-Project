The comic book page is a vibrant display of four panels, each telling a part of a story. The main character, a woman dressed in a green dress, is the focal point of the comic. She is seen in various stages of her journey, from sitting on a couch to standing in a room.

In the first panel, the woman is seated on a couch, engrossed in a book titled "Black Magic". The title of the book suggests a theme of mysticism or the supernatural.

The second panel shows the woman standing in a room, her attention drawn to a bird perched on a windowsill. The bird, with its wings spread wide, seems to be in mid-flight, adding a dynamic element to the scene.

In the third panel, the woman is now standing in front of a mirror. She is holding a book, possibly the same one she was reading in the first panel. The mirror reflects her image, creating a sense of depth and perspective.

The fourth and final panel brings the story full circle. The woman is back on the couch, now holding a cup of tea. The cup is placed on a table, suggesting a moment of relaxation or contemplation.

Throughout the comic, the woman's actions and the objects around her create a narrative that is open to interpretation. The text in the comic is minimal, with phrases like "Meanwhile, the jealous queen hears" and "I know! I'll change myself into a beautiful thing with a black magic spell!" hinting at a plot involving a jealous queen and a black magic spell. The comic leaves much to the imagination, inviting the reader to fill in the blanks with their own narrative.
