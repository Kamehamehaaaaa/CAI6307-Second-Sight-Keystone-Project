The comic book page is a vibrant display of the classic Disney character, Chippy, and his friends. The page is divided into six panels, each telling a part of the story.

In the first panel, Chippy is seen in a checkered shirt, sitting on a bench. He is holding a sign that reads "Mama-A-Going", indicating that he is about to embark on an adventure.

The second panel shows Chippy and his friends, Dale and Donald, in a park. They are all dressed in checkered shirts, matching Chippy's from the first panel. They are engaged in a conversation, with Chippy saying, "Wot's goodness, Mama-A-Going! These gentlemen are molestin' me!"

In the third panel, the trio is still in the park, but now they are being chased by a group of men. The men are holding baseball bats, suggesting a playful chase rather than a serious one.

The fourth panel shows Chippy and his friends running away from the men. They are now in a forest, with trees and bushes surrounding them.

The fifth panel is a close-up of Chippy's face. He is looking up at the sky, with a thoughtful expression on his face.

The final panel shows Chippy and his friends in a cave. They are sitting on a bench, with Chippy saying, "I guess I shouldn't have gone!" This panel seems to reflect on the events that have taken place in the previous panels.

Throughout the comic, the characters are depicted in a cartoon style, with exaggerated expressions and movements. The colors are bright and vibrant, adding to the overall cheerful and adventurous atmosphere of the comic. The text in the comic is clear and legible, providing context and dialogue for the characters.
