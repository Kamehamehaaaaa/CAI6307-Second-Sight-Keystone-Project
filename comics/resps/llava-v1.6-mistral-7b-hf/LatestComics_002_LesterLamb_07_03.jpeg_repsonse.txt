The comic book page is a dynamic sequence of four panels, each telling a part of a story. The main characters are a young girl and a white rabbit.

In the first panel, the girl is seen smoking a cigarette, with the smoke rising upwards. The rabbit, seemingly unbothered, is standing next to her.

The second panel shows the girl and the rabbit in a room with a mirror. The girl is now holding a bucket, and the rabbit is still standing next to her.

In the third panel, the girl is now holding a broom, and the rabbit is still standing next to her. The girl appears to be in a state of distress, as indicated by the text "FIRE! HELP!"

The fourth panel shows the girl and the rabbit in a different room, with a fire hydrant visible in the background. The girl is now holding a fire extinguisher, and the rabbit is still standing next to her. The text "STOP IT! I'M A BAAAAD BOY!" suggests that the rabbit is now speaking, adding a humorous element to the scene.

Throughout the comic, the girl and the rabbit are the main focus, with their actions and expressions driving the narrative. The text provides additional context and dialogue, enhancing the storytelling aspect of the comic. The use of a mirror in the second panel adds a unique visual element to the scene. The fire hydrant in the fourth panel suggests that the story might involve a fire or an emergency situation. The overall tone of the comic is light-hearted and humorous, with the girl and the rabbit appearing to be in a playful or exaggerated situation.
