The comic book page is a vibrant display of four panels, each telling a part of a story. The characters are anthropomorphic bees, each with their own unique role in the narrative.

In the first panel, we see a bee dressed in a sombrero and red pants, standing on a cliff. He is holding a sign that reads, "Nice work, B-39. To the Sheriff's office with you, Jap!" This suggests a conflict or rivalry between the bees and the Japanese.

The second panel shows a bee in a blue suit and red pants, running away from a tree. The text "We gotta get started. The germ carrying flies are due at two!" indicates a sense of urgency and the impending arrival of the flies.

The third panel features a bee in a yellow suit and red pants, who is flying over a crowd of bees. The text "Put the paper here and put the honey on thick!" suggests that the bees are preparing for a special event or celebration.

The fourth and final panel shows a bee in a black suit and red pants, flying over a crowd of bees. The text "Sounds great! Must be heaven!" implies that the bees are excited about the upcoming event.

Throughout the comic, the bees are depicted in various actions and attire, adding to the dynamic nature of the story. The text provides context and dialogue, further enhancing the narrative. The comic seems to be a humorous take on bee life, with the characters engaging in activities such as running, flying, and preparing for an event.
