The comic page is a vibrant display of adventure and intrigue, set against the backdrop of a bustling harbor. The story unfolds through a series of panels, each telling a part of the narrative.

In the first panel, we see a man in a suit, standing on a boat, looking out at the water. He seems to be deep in thought, perhaps contemplating the journey ahead.

The second panel introduces us to a group of people on a boat. They are engaged in a conversation, with one person saying, "Back on the sea Hawkthe operations' chief engineer had a look at the pumps. He says the pumps are all right." This suggests that the boat is in good condition and ready for the journey.

The third panel shows the same man from the first panel, now on a different boat. He is looking at a map, possibly planning the route for their journey.

The fourth panel takes us back to the first boat, where the man in the suit is now talking to another man. The man in the suit says, "The old schooner lies on the bottom, with her hold filled with water. Her hull is filled with water. Her hull is filled with water. Her hull is filled with water.
