The comic page is a vibrant display of adventure and camaraderie. It's divided into three panels, each telling a part of the story.

In the first panel, we see a man named "TABOO" standing on a boat, looking out at the ocean. He's wearing a yellow shirt and a hat, suggesting a sunny day. He's holding a rope, possibly tying it to the boat.

The second panel is a close-up of a man named "BANDARA". He's wearing a blue shirt and is holding a compass, indicating that they might be navigating.

The third panel is a bit more action-packed. It shows a man named "ASHMORE" holding a gun, ready for action. He's wearing a brown shirt and is standing on a boat.

The text on the page provides context to the scene. It reads:

"And so, equipped for a salvage hawk job, they set out to sea. BANDARA, the navigator, was easily located. They anchored near by, but SALVAGE OPERATIONS were in full swing.
