The comic book page is a vibrant display of four panels, each telling a part of a story. The characters are anthropomorphic animals, with a distinctly cartoonish style.

In the first panel, a man is seen riding a horse, with a speech bubble that reads "Um-a!" This suggests a moment of surprise or realization.

The second panel introduces a new character, a woman, who is seen riding a horse as well. She is wearing a crown, indicating a position of authority or royalty.

The third panel shows the same man from the first panel, now interacting with the woman from the second panel. He is holding a crown, and the woman is holding a scepter, suggesting a formal or ceremonial interaction.

The fourth and final panel shows the same man and woman from the previous panels, now surrounded by a group of other anthropomorphic animals. The man is holding a crown, and the woman is holding a scepter, reinforcing their royal status. The other animals are looking on, possibly indicating a gathering or event.

Throughout the comic, the characters are depicted in various poses and expressions, adding to the dynamic nature of the story. The text and images together create a narrative that is open to interpretation, inviting the reader to fill in the blanks with their own imagination.
