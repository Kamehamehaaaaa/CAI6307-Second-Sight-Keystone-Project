The comic book page is a vibrant display of a story unfolding. The setting is a room with a large window, through which a man and a woman can be seen. The man is dressed in a suit, while the woman is in a dress. They appear to be engaged in a conversation.

In the foreground, a woman is standing, her attention seemingly drawn to the man and woman outside. She is dressed in a blue dress and has a concerned expression on her face.
