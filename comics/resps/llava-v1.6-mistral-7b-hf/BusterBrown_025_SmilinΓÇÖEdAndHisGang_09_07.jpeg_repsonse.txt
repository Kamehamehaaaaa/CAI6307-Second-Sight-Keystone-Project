The second panel shows the man outside, now with a dog. He seems to be enjoying the outdoors, perhaps taking a break from his journey.

In the third panel, the man is seen on a sled, being pulled by a team of dogs. The sled is moving through a snowy landscape, with trees visible in the background.

The fourth panel shows the man in a more precarious situation. He is now on skis, navigating through a forest. The trees are taller and more dense, suggesting a deeper journey into the wilderness.

The fifth panel is a dramatic turn of events. The man is now on a snowboard, being pulled by a team of dogs. The snowboard is being used as a makeshift sled, adding an element of danger and excitement to the journey.

The final panel shows the man in a precarious situation. He is now on a snowboard, being pulled by a team of dogs. The snowboard is being used as a makeshift sled, adding an element of danger and excitement to the journey.
