The comic book page is a four-panel sequence featuring a character named Rippy. The setting is a bedroom, and the character is depicted in various states of sleep and wakefulness.

In the first panel, Rippy is lying in bed, seemingly asleep. The text above him reads, "Nothing like a good night's sleep of a few months... AH-HN!"

The second panel shows Rippy waking up with a start, as indicated by the text "Drip! Drip! Drip!"

In the third panel, Rippy is now fully awake, with the text "SPLAT-T!" suggesting a sudden realization or realization of a problem.

The fourth panel shows Rippy in a state of distress, with the text "WOW!" indicating surprise or shock. The character is now standing up in bed, with a look of horror on his face.

Throughout the comic, the character's expressions and body language convey a sense of discomfort and distress, particularly in the final panel where he appears to be in a state of panic or fear. The text and visual elements work together to create a narrative of a character experiencing a sudden, unpleasant awakening.
