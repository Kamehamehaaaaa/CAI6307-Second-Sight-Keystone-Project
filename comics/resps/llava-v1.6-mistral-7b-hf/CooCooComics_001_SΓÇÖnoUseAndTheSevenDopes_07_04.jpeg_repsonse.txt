The comic book page is a vibrant display of a young girl named Tootsie and her adventures in a forest. The story is divided into four panels, each capturing a different moment of her journey.

In the first panel, Tootsie is seen sitting on a bench, her attention drawn to a bird perched on a nearby tree. She watches the bird with interest, her curiosity piqued.

The second panel takes us to a different scene. Tootsie is now standing in front of a tree, her gaze fixed on a sign that reads "B.B. Blue-Jay". The sign seems to be a clue or a direction, hinting at the presence of a blue jay in the forest.

The third panel shows Tootsie in action. She is now riding a horse, her posture suggesting she's in motion. The horse and Tootsie are set against the backdrop of the forest, adding a sense of adventure to the scene.

The fourth and final panel brings us back to the bench where Tootsie started her journey. This time, she's not alone. A blue jay has landed on the bench, its color matching the sign Tootsie saw earlier. The bird seems to be interacting with Tootsie, perhaps responding to her earlier observation.

Throughout the comic, the text "And so it goes" is repeated, possibly indicating the progression of Tootsie's adventure. The comic is rich in detail and color, making it an engaging read. The characters, Tootsie and the blue jay, are well-defined, and the setting, the forest, is vividly depicted. The interaction between Tootsie and the blue jay adds a dynamic element to the story.
