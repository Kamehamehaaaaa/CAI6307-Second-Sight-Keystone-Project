The comic book page is a lively display of cartoon characters and their interactions. The setting is a whimsical landscape, with a river flowing through a forest and a cliff in the background.

In the first panel, a character is seen flying through the air, holding a bucket. The character is wearing a hat and has a determined look on their face. The text reads, "Fools! Fools! Fools! What's the one thing I've got away?"

In the second panel, the character is now on the ground, having dropped the bucket. The text here reads, "I've got to stop him! He's going to get away!"

The third panel shows the character in a state of distress, with the text "Oh, oh, he's heading for Farmer Grays!"

The fourth panel introduces another character, a bee, who is flying towards the character with the bucket. The text here reads, "If you sting me you'll be sorry! That's what I'm gonna do!"

The fifth panel shows the bee landing on the character's shoulder, with the text "Bee! Bee! Bee! What's the matter with you? It's gonna be done!"

The final panel shows the character sitting at a desk, with the text "Hee! Hee! Now I make this is gonna hurt! With a switch of my tail!"

Throughout the comic, the characters are depicted in a cartoon style, with exaggerated expressions and movements. The text provides a humorous narrative, adding to the overall comedic tone of the comic.
