The comic book page is a vibrant display of four panels, each telling a part of a story. The characters are anthropomorphic animals, with a sheep and a dog being the main focus.

In the first panel, the sheep is sitting in a barber shop, waiting for his turn. The barber shop is filled with other animals, suggesting a bustling atmosphere. The sheep is holding a newspaper, perhaps to pass the time.

The second panel shows the sheep in the barber's chair, getting a haircut. The barber, a dog, is diligently working on the sheep's hair, indicating a professional and caring service.

The third panel takes us to a different setting, a beauty parlor. The sheep is now a customer, sitting in a chair and getting his hair styled. The dog, now the barber, is attentively working on the sheep's hair, showing a versatile skill set.

The fourth and final panel shows the sheep and the dog in a room with a curtain. The sheep is now holding a hair dryer, presumably to dry his hair after the styling session. The dog, still the barber, is attentively watching the sheep, ready to assist if needed.

Throughout the comic, the text "BAM! I WONDER WHAT IT IS IN THERE" is visible, suggesting a sense of curiosity or anticipation. The comic seems to be a humorous take on the beauty industry, with the sheep and the dog as its main characters.
