The comic book page is a four-panel strip featuring the character Willie. In the first panel, Willie is seen sitting on a bench, with a speech bubble that reads, "Why, Willie, you shouldn't fight like that." This suggests that Willie is engaged in a conversation with someone off-panel.

In the second panel, Willie is still on the bench, but now he's holding a fishing rod, indicating that he might be discussing fishing or sharing a fishing story.

The third panel shows Willie standing on a grassy field, with a speech bubble that says, "He called me a lot of names." This implies that Willie is recounting a recent altercation or disagreement.

The fourth and final panel brings the conversation back to the bench, with Willie saying, "I know I haven't." This could be a response to the names that were called in the previous panel.

Throughout the comic, Willie is the central character, and the interaction suggests a friendly, possibly mentor-mentee relationship. The setting is varied, with the first panel on a bench, the second panel still on the bench but with a fishing rod, and the third and fourth panels in a grassy field. The text in the speech bubbles provides context for the interactions and the storyline.
