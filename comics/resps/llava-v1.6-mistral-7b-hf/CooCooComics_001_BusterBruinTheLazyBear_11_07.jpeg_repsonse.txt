The comic book page is a vibrant display of six panels, each telling a part of a story. The main characters are a group of bears, each with their own unique personality.

In the first panel, we see a bear named Jasper, who is known for his love of popcorn. He's sitting comfortably in a chair, a bag of popcorn in his lap. His relaxed posture suggests he's enjoying a quiet moment.

The second panel introduces us to another bear, this one named Poppy. She's standing on a mountain, her gaze directed towards the sky. Her stance is one of determination, as if she's contemplating something important.

The third panel brings us back to Jasper, now lying on a bed. He's holding a book, his eyes focused on the pages. His expression is one of concentration, indicating he's deeply engrossed in his reading.

The fourth panel shows Poppy again, this time in a different setting. She's now in a forest, surrounded by trees. Her posture is one of alertness, suggesting she's on the lookout for something.

The fifth panel returns us to Jasper, who is now standing on a mountain. His gaze is directed towards the sky, mirroring Poppy's stance in the previous panel. His expression is one of surprise, indicating something unexpected has caught his attention.

The final panel brings the story to a close. Poppy and Jasper are now standing on a mountain, their expressions one of joy and accomplishment. The text "Yoo-hoo! Jasper! They're out climbing trees!" suggests they've successfully climbed a tree.

Throughout the comic, the text "I knowâ€”Eagles' Eggs!" is repeated, hinting at a recurring theme or perhaps a running joke between the characters. The overall narrative seems to revolve around the adventures of these two bears, their interactions with each other, and their shared love for popcorn and climbing trees.
