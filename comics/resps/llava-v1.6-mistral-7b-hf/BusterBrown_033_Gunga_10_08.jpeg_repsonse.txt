The comic book page is a captivating display of adventure and camaraderie. It's divided into four panels, each telling a part of the story.

In the first panel, we see a young man and an elephant in a grassy field. The elephant, a majestic creature, is standing tall, while the man is kneeling, seemingly in awe of the animal. The text "Fearlessly the young man without work seeks the runaway cow elephant" suggests a sense of adventure and the unusual circumstances that have brought these two characters together.

The second panel takes us to a different setting. The elephant and the man are now in a cave, with the elephant standing guard while the man is lying down, possibly resting or injured. The text "At last he finds Padmah" hints at a moment of relief or discovery.

The third panel shows the elephant and the man in a forest. The elephant is now carrying the man on its back, indicating a change in their relationship, perhaps a bond of trust and companionship. The text "Guna quickly eases the keddah hook" suggests a moment of care and preparation.

The final panel brings us back to the grassy field. The elephant and the man are now standing together, with the man holding a stick. The text "And Padmah is captured!" adds a dramatic twist to the story, leaving us curious about what will happen next.

Throughout the comic, the interaction between the man and the elephant is central, showing a unique bond between humans and animals. The settings vary from a grassy field to a cave and a forest, adding to the sense of adventure and exploration. The text provides context and hints at the narrative, inviting the reader to imagine the story behind these illustrated scenes.
