The comic book page features a close-up of two characters, one with blonde hair and the other with black hair. The character with blonde hair appears to be speaking, as indicated by the word "SAY!" in bold letters above their head. The character with black hair is shown listening intently.
The background shows a blurred image of a cityscape at night, suggesting that the conversation is taking place in an urban environment. There are no other visible text or speech bubbles on this page, so the focus is solely on the interaction between the two characters. The style of the artwork is typical of comic books, with bold lines and shading used to create depth and emphasis.
