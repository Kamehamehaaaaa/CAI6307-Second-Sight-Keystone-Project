The first character is a muscular man wearing a black suit with red accents and a cape. He has a stern expression on his face as he confronts the second character, who is a woman dressed in a green jumpsuit with a utility belt. She appears to be holding some kind of device or weapon in her hand.
As they stand facing each other, there is tension in the air. The man's body language suggests that he is ready for a fight, while the woman seems to be preparing to defend herself.

The woman responds defiantly: "I won't let you hurt anyone else. You're not the only one who deserves justice."
