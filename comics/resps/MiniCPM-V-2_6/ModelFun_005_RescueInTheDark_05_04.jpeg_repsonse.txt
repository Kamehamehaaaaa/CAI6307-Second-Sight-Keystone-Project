The comic book page depicts a tense interaction between two characters. The setting appears to be an urban environment, possibly during the daytime given the natural light and shadows visible in the background.
In the foreground, one character is shown from behind, facing away from the viewer. This character has long hair and is wearing what seems to be a casual outfit. They are holding a small object or weapon in their hand, which they appear to be examining closely.
Opposite them, another character is shown in profile view, with their face partially obscured by shadow. This character is dressed in a more formal attire, suggesting a contrast in their roles or status within the narrative. Their expression is serious, and they seem to be intently focused on the first character's actions.
The dialogue box contains text that reads, "I'll find you," indicating a sense of determination or resolve from the second character. The exchange suggests a confrontation or pursuit, as if the second character is vowing to track down the first character for some reason.
Overall, the scene conveys a sense of urgency and conflict between the two characters, set against an everyday backdrop that highlights the dramatic tension of their encounter.
