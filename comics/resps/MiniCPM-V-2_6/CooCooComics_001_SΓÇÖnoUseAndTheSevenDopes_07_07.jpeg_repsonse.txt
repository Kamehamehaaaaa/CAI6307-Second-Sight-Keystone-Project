In this comic book page, we see a scene set in an urban environment with tall buildings and busy streets. The main character is a young woman named Maya, who appears to be in her mid-20s. She has long black hair, wears glasses, and is dressed in casual clothing.
Maya is walking down the street when she suddenly stops and looks up at the sky. Her expression is one of surprise or shock as she gazes upwards. As she does so, a bright light appears above her head, illuminating her face and casting shadows on her surroundings.
The next panel shows Maya looking down towards the ground, still in awe of what she just saw. Suddenly, she notices something moving out of the corner of her eye. She turns around and sees a group of people approaching her from behind.
The group consists of three men, all wearing suits and ties. They are walking quickly towards Maya, their faces grimacing as they approach. Maya's expression becomes one of fear or concern as she realizes that these men might be after her.
As the men get closer, Maya starts to back away slowly, trying to find a way out of the situation. However, the men close in on her, blocking her path and trapping her against the wall. Maya's heart races as she tries to think of a way to escape.
Finally, one of the men steps forward and grabs Maya by the arm, pulling her towards him. She struggles to free herself, but he is too strong. In the last panel, we see Maya being dragged away by the group of men, her body limp as they carry her off into the distance.
Throughout the sequence, the art style remains consistent, with bold lines and vivid colors that help to convey the action and emotion of the scene. The use of perspective and lighting helps to create a sense of tension and drama, making the reader feel the urgency and danger of the situation.
