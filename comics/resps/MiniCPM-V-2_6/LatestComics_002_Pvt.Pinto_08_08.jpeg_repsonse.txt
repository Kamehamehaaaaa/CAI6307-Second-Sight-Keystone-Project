The comic book page depicts a scene with two characters, one of whom is in the foreground and appears to be male, wearing a suit. He is shown from the chest up, looking directly at something off-panel. The other character is partially visible in the background, seemingly female, with her hair tied back and dressed in casual clothing.
The setting appears to be an urban environment, possibly a street or alleyway, as suggested by the presence of buildings and what looks like a metal fence or railing. There is also a sense of motion or action conveyed through the use of lines and shading, particularly around the figures' limbs and the background elements.
There is no dialogue present on this page, but there are captions that provide context for the characters' actions. One caption reads "THEY ARE COMING FOR ME," which suggests a sense of urgency or danger. Another caption says "I HAVE TO RUN," indicating that the male character is in a hurry to escape or avoid something. The final caption reads "TO THE ROOF!" which implies that he intends to climb to a higher vantage point, likely for safety or concealment.
Overall, the page conveys a tense and urgent situation involving the male character's attempt to evade whatever threat is pursuing him, while also hinting at a broader narrative involving his pursuit and potential rescue.
