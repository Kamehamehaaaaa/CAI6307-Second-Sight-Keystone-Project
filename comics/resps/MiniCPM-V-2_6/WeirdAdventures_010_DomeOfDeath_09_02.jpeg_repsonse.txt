In this comic book page, the setting is a bustling city street with tall buildings and busy traffic. The characters are two women walking down the sidewalk; one is wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase, while the other is dressed in casual clothes.
The first woman stops to look at her phone, which she holds in her hand. She appears to be engaged in a conversation or reading something on the screen. The second woman continues walking, seemingly unaware of the first woman's actions.
As they walk past each other, there is no interaction between them. The focus of the scene is on the first woman and her phone, suggesting that it may play an important role in the story.
There is no text present on the page, so the reader must rely on the visuals to understand what is happening. However, the body language and expressions of the characters suggest a sense of urgency or importance about whatever is on the phone screen.
