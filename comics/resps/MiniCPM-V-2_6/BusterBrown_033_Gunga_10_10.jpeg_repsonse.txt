The comic book page depicts a tense moment between two characters. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly within a room or an office. One character is seated at a desk, while the other stands in front of them, creating a sense of confrontation.
The standing character has short hair and is wearing a dark suit with a white shirt underneath. They are gesturing with their hands as they speak, indicating that they are likely making a point or trying to persuade the seated character.
The seated character is dressed in a light-colored suit and is holding a pen and paper, suggesting that they may have been working on something before this interaction began. Their posture is slightly slouched, and they appear to be listening intently to the standing character.
There is no visible text on the page, but the body language of the characters suggests a serious conversation taking place. The overall tone of the scene is one of tension and conflict.
