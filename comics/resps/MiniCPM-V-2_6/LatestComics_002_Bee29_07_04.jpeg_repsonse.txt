In this comic book page, the scene is set in a dimly lit room with high ceilings and an old-fashioned chandelier hanging from above. The walls are adorned with ornate wallpaper and framed pictures of the past.
The main character, a woman named Emma, is sitting at a desk in the center of the room. She has long, curly red hair and wears glasses. Her expression is one of deep concentration as she looks down at a piece of paper in front of her. The paper appears to be a letter or document that she is reading.
As she reads, another character enters the room. This person is a man with short brown hair and a stern expression on his face. He is dressed in a suit and tie and carries a briefcase. He approaches Emma's desk and stands behind her, observing her actions.
Emma continues to read the document, seemingly oblivious to the man's presence. However, when she finishes, she looks up and notices him standing there. There is a moment of tension between them as they exchange glances.
The man then speaks, "Emma, I have some important news for you."
Emma nods, setting the document aside on the desk. "What is it?" she asks, her voice calm but curious.
The man takes a deep breath before continuing. "We received word today that your father has passed away."
Emma's expression changes to one of shock and sadness. "My father? What happened?"
The man hesitates for a moment before replying. "He was found dead in his study this morning. We believe it was a heart attack."
Emma's eyes fill with tears as she processes the information. The man reaches out to place a hand on her shoulder, offering comfort.
The page ends with Emma sitting alone at the desk, her head resting in her hands as she mourns the loss of her father. The room around her is quiet, save for the sound of her sobs.
