In this comic book page, we see a young boy with brown hair and a blue shirt sitting in a classroom. He appears to be deep in thought as he looks out of the window at the bustling city street outside. The teacher, an older woman with glasses, is standing at the front of the room, speaking to the class.
As she speaks, the boy's attention is drawn to a mysterious figure walking down the street. It's a tall, thin man dressed in black with a hood covering his face. The boy watches as the man disappears into a nearby alleyway.
The teacher notices the boy's distracted expression and calls him out. She asks if he's okay and tells him to pay attention. The boy nods and resumes listening to the lesson, but his mind is still preoccupied with the mysterious figure he saw earlier.
The setting is a typical classroom with desks, chairs, and educational posters on the walls. Outside the window, the city street is busy with people walking by and cars driving down the road. The overall tone of the page is one of curiosity and intrigue, as the boy tries to make sense of what he saw outside.
