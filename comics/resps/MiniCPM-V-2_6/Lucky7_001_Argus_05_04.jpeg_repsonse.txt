In this comic book page, the setting appears to be a room with walls adorned with various posters and artwork. The characters present are two individuals: one is seated at a desk, while the other stands beside them. The person standing is wearing glasses and has short hair, suggesting they might be male. They seem to be in conversation or giving instructions to the seated individual, who is partially obscured by the angle of the shot but appears to have long hair, possibly female.
The seated character is focused on something out of frame, likely related to their work at the desk. There's a sense of urgency or intensity about their posture and expression. The environment suggests a casual, creative workspace, perhaps an office or studio where ideas are exchanged and projects are discussed.
There's no visible text within the panel that provides additional context for the scene or dialogue between the characters.
