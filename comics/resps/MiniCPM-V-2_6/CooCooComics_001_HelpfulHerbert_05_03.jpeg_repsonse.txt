In this comic book page, we see a character named the Black Hood standing in an urban environment. He is dressed in black with a hood covering his head and face, giving him a mysterious appearance. The setting appears to be a city street at night, with buildings lining the sides of the road and a dark sky overhead.
The Black Hood is shown interacting with another character who is holding up a sign that reads "I am the enemy." This suggests some form of confrontation or conflict between the two characters. The Black Hood's expression is serious and intense as he looks down at the sign, indicating that he may be considering what it means for him or his mission.
There are no other visible characters or objects in the scene, and the focus is solely on the interaction between the Black Hood and the person holding the sign. The overall tone of the page is tense and dramatic, with a sense of impending action or violence.
