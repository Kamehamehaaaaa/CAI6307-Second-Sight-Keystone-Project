In this comic book page, we see a young woman with long brown hair and green eyes standing in what appears to be an abandoned industrial area. She is wearing a white lab coat over a black shirt and pants, suggesting she may be a scientist or researcher.
As she stands there, she looks up at the sky, her expression one of concern or worry. Suddenly, a group of people dressed in military uniforms appear on the horizon, approaching her position.
The woman seems to be waiting for them, as if expecting their arrival. The soldiers are led by a man who appears to be in charge, his face stern and commanding.
As they get closer, the woman begins to speak, her voice calm but firm. "I've been waiting for you," she says. "I have something important to tell you."
The soldiers stop in their tracks, their weapons lowered slightly as they listen to her. The atmosphere is tense, as if anything could happen at any moment.
The scene ends with the woman still speaking, her words carrying weight and importance. It's clear that whatever she has to say is going to change things, both for her and for those around her.
