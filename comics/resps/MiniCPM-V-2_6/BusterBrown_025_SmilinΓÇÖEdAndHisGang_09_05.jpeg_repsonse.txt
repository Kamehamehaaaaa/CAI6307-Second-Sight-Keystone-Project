The comic book page depicts a tense confrontation between two characters in an urban nighttime setting. The character on the left is a woman with short, dark hair, dressed in a red jacket and black pants. She appears determined and confrontational as she faces the other character.
The character on the right is a man with long, disheveled brown hair, wearing a leather jacket and jeans. He has a stern expression and seems to be ready for a physical altercation. The background shows a dimly lit street with buildings, adding to the sense of danger and urgency.
There is no visible text or dialogue on this page, but the body language and expressions suggest a high-stakes situation where both characters are prepared for conflict.
