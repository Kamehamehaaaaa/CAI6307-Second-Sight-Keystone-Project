The comic book page features a single panel showcasing a young boy with brown hair, wearing a blue shirt and jeans. He appears to be in his early teens and is looking down at something on the ground, seemingly puzzled or curious. The background reveals an urban setting with tall buildings and a clear sky, indicating it might be daytime.
In the foreground, there's a small, green, glowing object that resembles a portal or a device emitting light. It seems to have captured the boy's attention as he leans forward slightly towards it. There are no other characters visible in this scene, suggesting the focus is solely on the boy and the mysterious object before him.
There is no text present within this panel, which emphasizes the visual storytelling aspect of the comic. The lack of dialogue allows the reader to immerse themselves in the moment, pondering what the object could be and how it might relate to the story's overall plot.
