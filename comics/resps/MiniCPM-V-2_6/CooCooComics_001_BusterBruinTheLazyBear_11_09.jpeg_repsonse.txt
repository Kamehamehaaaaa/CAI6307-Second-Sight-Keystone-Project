The comic book page features a dramatic scene with two main characters, a man and a woman. The man is wearing a dark suit and appears to be in his 30s or 40s, while the woman has long brown hair and looks younger, possibly in her 20s.
They are standing in a room that has a modern design with sleek lines and minimalistic furniture. There is a large window behind them that offers a view of the city skyline at night. The lighting in the room is dim, with a soft glow coming from the window.
The man is speaking to the woman, who is looking at him with concern on her face. Their interaction suggests a serious conversation, perhaps related to their personal lives or work.
In the background, there is a small desk with a computer monitor and some papers scattered on it. The overall tone of the page is tense and emotional, with a focus on the dialogue between the two characters.
