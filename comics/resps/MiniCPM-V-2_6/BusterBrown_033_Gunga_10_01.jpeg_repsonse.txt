In this comic book page, the scene is set in a dimly lit alleyway at night. The main character, a young woman with red hair and wearing a black jacket, is walking cautiously through the narrow passageway. She appears to be on edge, looking over her shoulder as if she's expecting someone to follow her.
As she walks, she passes by a group of men who are standing near some crates. They appear to be talking amongst themselves, but their conversation seems to catch the attention of the young woman. Suddenly, one of the men turns towards her, and she freezes in fear.
The man steps forward, holding out his hand as if he wants to grab her. But before he can make contact, another figure steps out from behind him, knocking him down with a single punch. This second figure is tall and muscular, with a scar running down the side of his face. He introduces himself as a bodyguard for a wealthy businessman, and he tells the young woman that he has been hired to protect her.
Together, they walk deeper into the alleyway, with the bodyguard keeping a close eye on their surroundings. As they move, they hear footsteps approaching from above them. It becomes clear that they are being pursued, and the tension between them rises as they prepare to defend themselves against whoever is chasing them.
