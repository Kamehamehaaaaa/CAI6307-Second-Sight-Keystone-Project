In the comic book page, we see a young woman with brown hair and a determined expression. She is wearing a green tank top and black pants. The background shows an urban environment with tall buildings and a clear sky.
As she walks through the city streets, she encounters a man in a suit who appears to be following her. He looks nervous as he approaches her. The woman stops and faces him, her expression serious.
The man speaks, but his words are not audible in the narration. The woman listens intently, her eyes focused on him. There is tension between them as they stand facing each other.
Suddenly, a group of men in suits appear from around the corner, surrounding the woman and the man in the suit. They look menacing as they approach.
The woman stands her ground, her body language suggesting that she is ready for a fight. The man in the suit seems to be pleading with her, but it's unclear what he is saying.
The scene ends abruptly, leaving us to wonder what will happen next. The text on the page does not provide any additional information about the characters or their motivations.
