The comic book page depicts a dramatic interaction between two characters in a tense setting. The background features a dark, stormy sky with lightning illuminating the scene, suggesting an intense or dangerous situation. One character is shown from behind, facing away from the viewer, while another character is partially visible on the right side of the frame.
As for text, there is only one panel containing dialogue that reads: "He's not coming back." This statement implies a sense of urgency and concern about the well-being of someone important to the characters involved. The dialogue suggests a narrative where the characters are dealing with a crisis or a significant event involving this missing person.
