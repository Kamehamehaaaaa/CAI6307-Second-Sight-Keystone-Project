In the comic book page, we see a scene featuring two characters in an outdoor setting. The character on the left appears to be a young woman with long hair, wearing a dark-colored outfit that suggests she might be a vigilante or hero of some kind. She is holding what looks like a small device or weapon in her hand.

The character on the right seems to be a man dressed in a suit and tie, indicating he could be a civilian or possibly a businessman. He is gesturing with his hands as if he is explaining something or making a point.

The background shows a cityscape at night, with tall buildings and streetlights illuminating the area. There are no other people visible in the scene, suggesting that this conversation between the two characters is taking place in a somewhat isolated part of the city.

The dialogue bubble from the man says "You can't just...," but the rest of the sentence is cut off, so it's unclear what he is trying to say. However, based on his body language and facial expression, it seems like he is concerned or frustrated about something.

Overall, the scene appears to be a tense moment where the two characters are having a serious discussion, possibly about a situation involving crime or danger.
