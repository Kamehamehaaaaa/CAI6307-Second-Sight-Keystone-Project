The comic book page features a dramatic scene with two characters in the foreground, one male and one female. The male character is dressed in dark clothing and appears to be in motion, possibly running or leaping, while the female character wears lighter-colored clothes and seems to be either falling backward or being pushed away from the male character.
In the background, there is a large, ominous figure that appears to be attacking the couple. This figure has exaggerated features, such as oversized hands and feet, and is wearing a mask that covers its entire head. It is depicted as towering over the couple, creating an intense sense of danger and threat.
The setting appears to be an outdoor location, with natural elements like trees and rocks visible in the background. The overall color palette is dark and moody, with shades of gray, black, and muted greens dominating the scene.
There is no text present on this page, so the focus is entirely on the visual storytelling through the imagery and composition of the panels. The interaction between the characters and their surroundings suggests a high-stakes situation, likely involving action, conflict, and tension.
