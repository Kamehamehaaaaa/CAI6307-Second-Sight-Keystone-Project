The comic book page features a close-up of two characters, a young woman with long blonde hair and a determined expression, and an older man with gray hair and a stern demeanor. They are both standing in a room that appears to be a laboratory or workshop, filled with various pieces of equipment and machinery.
The young woman is holding a device in her hand, which she seems to be examining closely. The older man is standing behind her, observing her actions with a critical eye. He is wearing glasses and has a mustache, adding to his authoritative presence.
As the characters interact, there is a sense of tension between them. The young woman appears focused and determined, while the older man seems skeptical and unimpressed by her work. Their expressions suggest that they are engaged in a serious conversation about the device in question.
Throughout the panel, the focus remains on the characters and their interaction, with no additional text or dialogue provided. The artwork captures the intensity of their exchange, using body language and facial expressions to convey the underlying emotions and motivations of each character.
