The setting appears to be indoors, as suggested by the background elements that resemble walls and possibly furniture. The characters are depicted through detailed line work and shading, which gives them a three-dimensional appearance.

The other character's body language indicates attentiveness, perhaps listening or considering what is being said.
Throughout the page, there are panels that focus on different aspects of the interaction, such as close-ups of facial expressions or specific gestures. This helps convey the emotions and intentions of the characters more effectively. The use of shadows and highlights adds depth to the scene, enhancing the overall visual impact of the panel.
