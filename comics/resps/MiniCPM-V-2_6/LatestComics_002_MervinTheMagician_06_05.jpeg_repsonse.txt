The comic book page depicts a scene with two characters in the foreground, one appearing to be a young boy and the other an older man. The boy is wearing casual clothing, while the man is dressed more formally. They are standing on what seems to be a street or public area, with buildings visible in the background.
The dialogue box contains text that reads "You're going to be fine." This suggests that the older character is providing reassurance or encouragement to the younger character. There is no additional text or speech bubbles present on the page, so it's unclear who else might be involved in the conversation or what the context of their interaction may be.
Overall, the setting appears to be urban, and the interaction between the two characters seems to be friendly or supportive in nature.
