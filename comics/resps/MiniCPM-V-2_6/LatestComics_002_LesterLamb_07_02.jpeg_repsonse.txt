The comic book page features a close-up of two characters in conversation. The character on the left is depicted with fair skin, wearing glasses and dressed in a dark suit, suggesting a professional or formal setting. This character appears to be speaking to the other individual, indicated by their open mouth and expressive facial features.
The second character has darker skin, sporting a casual outfit consisting of a red shirt and jeans. Their posture and relaxed attire suggest they are at ease in this interaction. They seem to be listening attentively, as evidenced by their focused gaze and slightly raised eyebrows.
The background is minimalistic, emphasizing the characters' faces and expressions. There's no text present within the panel, allowing the reader to focus solely on the visual cues provided by the characters' body language and facial expressions. The lack of additional context makes it difficult to determine the exact nature of their conversation or the story's broader narrative.
