Chad greets a long line of islanders on the beach while Kala secures their own canoe to a dead log behind him. Chad waves and tells the greeting party, “WE HAVE COME TO TRY AND MAKE YOUR SON WELL!” The leading man in the party says, “...IF YOU MAKE BOY GOOD, ME BE YOUR FRIEND ALL TIME!” A narration box signals the transition to another scene, “MEANWHILE ANOTHER SHIP IS VERY NEAR TO BANDARA ISLAND! IT’S THE ‘SWIFT’, BEAU DILLION’S SHIP, AND IN THE CABIN BEAU AND HIS BUCKO MATE, HAM STONE, ARE TALKING….”
Ham Stone leans over a table in the Swift and speaks with Beau Dillion. They are having a conversation over three bottles of some drink, but we cannot see what is written on the label of the single standing one. Ham Stone wears a brown sweater and a blue engineer’s cap, saying “YER SURE THAT WAS THE ‘SEA HAWK’ IN THE COVE?” with a shot glass in his hand. Holding up a thin cigar, Beau Dillion replies, “POSITIVE! WITH THE GLASSES I CAN MAKE HER OUR EASY! I COULDN’T MISTAKE THE MARCON’ RIG!”
Ham Stone questions Beau Dillion, “WE GOIN’ RIGHT AFTER HER?” Beau Dillion answers, putting the cigar in his mouth, “NOT YET! WE’LL STAND OFF SHORE AND WAIT… MAYBE OLD MOONEY TOLD HIM WHERE THE ‘ISLAND QUEEN’ AND THE TREASURE IS! IF HE RAISES IT, WE’LL GO OUT AND TAKE OVER!”
A narration box above the calves and feet of a crowd of islanders says, “MEANWHILE, CHAD AND KALA ARE ON THEIR MISSION OF MERCY! THE BOY’S ILLNESS PROVED TO BE A BAD INFECTION CAUSED BY A LONG SLIVER IN HIS LEG! THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD, AND HE WAS EXTREMELY WEAK WITH FEVER! CHAD WENT TO WORK…….” Chad crouches over the sick boy who lies beneath a white sheet, and he holds a white tool in his hand. He speaks, “I’VE GOT THE SLIVER, KALA! NOW WE’LL STERILIZE THE WOUND, AND HE’LL BE ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY!” Kala, holding a cloth outspread in his hands, watches Chad work.
