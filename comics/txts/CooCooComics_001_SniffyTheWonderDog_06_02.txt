The customer, a red-haired man in a blue suit and hat, stands next to Sniffy, a scruffy yellow dog with a "For Sale" sign, exclaiming, "AH—HH! THE POOR LIDDLE FELLER…" as Sniffy wails, "WAH!" 
The customer, now closer, gently says, "NICE DOGGIE…" while Sniffy looks up with hopeful eyes. 
The customer, smitten, getting licked by Sniffy on his cheeks, declares, "SWEET LIDDLE FELLER—I’M GONNA BUY HIM!!" 
The customer is seen hesitating, imagining his wife in a striped dress angrily shouting, as he mutters, "OH—OH! THE WIFE DOESN’T LIKE DOGS!" Sniffy watches nervously from the counter.
The man looks back at Sniffy and exclaims, “POOF!!!”, and snaps his wife’s picture out of his mind.
The customer recoils with a "HUH! OOPS!" as his imagination escalates, picturing his wife, her disapproval clear. 
The customer, now resolute, standing at the counter announces to the shopkeeper, a stout bald man in a green suit, "I’D LIKE TO BUY THAT DOG!" The shopkeeper, confused, asks, "DOG? WHAT DOG?”, a "Pets" sign is seen behind him. The rain outside persists.
