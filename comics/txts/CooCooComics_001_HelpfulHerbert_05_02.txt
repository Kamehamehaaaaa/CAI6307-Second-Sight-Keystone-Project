The water-horse, overinflated from the previous page, looms large and round, setting the stage for the explosion to come.
The overinflated water-horse eventually explodes with a loud “Bang!”
The large woman in the orange swimsuit scolds Herbert, "NOW SEE WHAT YOU’VE DONE! YOU BRUTE!" as Herbert offers, "I’LL BUY HER ANOTHER WATER-HORSE-" while Betty screems, "BAH! I WANT MY WATTA HORSE!".
The woman’s frustration escalates as she yells, “HOW WILL YOU BUY A NEW RUBBER WATER-HORSE? DON’T YOU KNOW THERE’S A WAR ON? OR ARE YOU MISTER PRIORITY?” with an indignant cry, “BAH!" from Betty.  
Herbert, exasperated, mutters, "GOSH! SOME PEOPLE DON’T APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU TRY T’DO ‘EM A FAVOR!" with Herbert walks away, puffing angrily.
