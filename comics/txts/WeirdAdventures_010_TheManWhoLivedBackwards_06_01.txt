A man with short hair and a strong jawline grimaces in horror, exhausted, while the heads of a shocked woman and a grinning round-face man wearing an officer’s cap are behind him. In the background, a blonde scientist holds a blue beaker among other chemistry equipment. In the background, a man falls backward off of a cliff. Narration introduces the story, “My soul was steeped in horror… UNDILUTED HORROR! It flooded over me like an overwhelming torrent - - and it was powerless within its grip! The UNIMAGINABLE… the IMPOSSIBLE was happening to me, and all I could do was writhe in the helpless agony for I was doomed as… ‘The MAN WHO LIVED BACKWARDS!’”
Another narration box continues, “I LITTLE DREAMED OF WHAT LAY AHEAD OF ME THAT EVENING WHEN I DROPPED IN TO SEE MY BEST FRIEND, DAVID BRANT…”
David Bryant, a blonde man in a brown suit and yellow spotted bowtie, lifts a glass, saying “A TOAST TO YOU, PAUL… AND TO PEGGY! MY BEST WISHES FOR YOUR WEDDING TOMORROW! AND WE MIGHT AS WELL DRINK A TOAST TO TOMORROW AND HAPPINESS!” Paul thanks him, “THANKS, DAVID!”
Between panels, a narration box says, “A FEW MINUTES LATER, I SAID GOODNIGHT TO DAVID AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS WHERE THE DOORMAN HAD MY CAR READY.”
The door man stands by Paul Brant’s yellow car and congratulates him, “MR. BRENT SAID YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW, MR. MARTIN. CONGRATULATIONS, SIR. BUT TOMORROW IS A LONG WAYS OFF! HA! HA! YOU CAN STILL CHANGE YOU MIND.” Paul replies, “NOT A CHANCE, MIKE. I LOVE THE GIRL!”
