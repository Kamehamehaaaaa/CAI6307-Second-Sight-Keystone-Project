Gertie expresses fear, "I FEEL A LITTLE SHAKEY, FINNY! ER.. MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T GO ANY FURTHER!" while Finny, like a hero with a red bow tie and cap, bravely declares, "AWRIGHT! TURN BACK! IF YOU’RE AFWAID! I’M GOING ON!" 
Gertie relents, “A-ALL RIGHT! I’M N-NOT AFRAID! I’LL F-FOLLOW YOU!" as a sign warns, "IF YOU WISH TO REMAIN ALIVE TURN BACK" which Finny points out exclaiming “GULP! LOOK!” and the scene has bones scattered around.
Gertie and Finny both gasp, "DOUBLE GULP!” While a sign reading, “WE DIDN’T” points two two skeletons hanging from a tree.
Gertie while looking at Johnny and Spike exclaims, “LOOK! SOMEONE IS COMING THIS WAY—AND IN A HURRY, TOO!" and Finny greets Spike and Johnny, "IT’S SPIKE AND JOHNNY! HIYA, FELLAS, WHAT’S UP?" 
Spike shouts, "RUN, FINNY! THERE’S A GREAT BIG SEA-DRAGON CHASIN’ US!" while Finny skeptically retorts, "THAT’S CWAZY! THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS A DWAGON!"
Finny questions, "…OR IS THERE?" with a massive green dragon emerging, its jaws open. 
Finny, trembling, asks, "WHO’S AFRAID OF DWAGONS… BESIDES ME?" as the dragon’s stares at Finny, while the other three characters run making "SWISH SWISH SWISH" sound effects.
