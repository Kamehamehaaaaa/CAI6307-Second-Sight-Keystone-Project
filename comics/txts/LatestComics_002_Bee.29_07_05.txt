In a clever, wartime comic scene, a group of germ-carrying enemy flies approaches the honey trap set by the bees, buzzing through a cloudy sky with signs like "FLY'S REST" and "HOW FAR CAN A FLY FLY?" visible below. One cautious fly warns, "TAKE IT EASY! IT MAY BE A TRAP!" but others dismiss the concern, exhausted, with one saying, "NUTS! I'M ALL POOPED OUT!" and another adding, "ME TOO! I GOTTA GET REST!" A third fly scoffs at the caution, retorting, "FOOLS! WHAT WOULD EMPEROR SAY?" as they descend toward the honey-laden area, eager for relief.
The flies land on the honey-covered surface, surrounded by signs like "SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR FLIES," and immediately express delight, with one exclaiming, "AH! HONEY STUFF! TERRA FIRMA AT LAST!" and another sighing, "PEACE! IT'S WONDERFUL!" as they settle in, unaware of the trap. The bees, including Bee 29, watch slyly from behind a large red flower, their plan unfolding perfectly. The flies soon realize their mistake, struggling as one shouts, "ER—STICKY STUFF!" and another cries, "I CAN'T MOVE! STUCK!" their wings and bodies glued to the honey.
Bee 29, wearing a blue cape and goggles, takes charge, declaring, "OK, MEN! WE'VE GOT 'EM! AND WE CAN'T EVEN MAKE SUICIDE FOR EMPEROR! WOE IS ME!" capturing the flies' despair at their failure to serve their emperor. The scene shifts as Bee 29 announces, "WE'LL CONSIGN THEM TO A WATERY GRAVE!" while the bees roll the honey-covered flies, still stuck, toward a river. The flies are wrapped in a large sheet of paper, their forms bulging beneath it, as the bees push them along a grassy hill. The comic ends with a triumphant "BOO-HOO!" from the bees, their victory complete as they thwart the enemy’s germ-spreading mission with a mix of cunning and humor.
