Massive eagle’s talons, with four digits and long, yellowed nails, and a severed rope tied around the left talon, decorate the foreground. Jafara falls backward toward the ground.
A narration box says, “BUT LITTLE JAFARA’S KIND DEED ALMOST COST HIM HIS LIFE.. A BROKEN TREE BRANCH, A PLUNGE TO EARTH, AND ONLY THE POWERFUL TALONS OF THE EAGLE SAVED HIM.. AND THEN JAFARA RECEIVED A SHOCK…
The eagle peers into Jafara’s eyes from the left side of the panel and makes his request, “QUICKLY, BOY! UNTIE THE THONG FROM MY LEG AND TIE IT ABOUT MY WAIST! .. HURRY! AND DO NOT BE TOO SURPRISED AT WHAT HAPPENS!” Shocked, Jafara can only shout, “YOU TALK?! THE EAGLE CAN TALK!!”
Narration midpage explains, “THE EAGLE SPOKE TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A STRANGE COMMAND, BUT JAFARA OBEYED QUICKLY, AND WHEN HE HAD TIED THE LEATHERN THONG ABOUT THE WAIST OF THE GREAT EAGLE…”
Jafara stands center-left of the following scene and looks up at a broad shouldered man with auburn hair. He asks, “B..BUT WHERE IS THE EAGLE?” The man replies, “I WAS THE EAGLE, BUT QUICKLY… STAND BEHIND ME FOR THE EVIL JINN WILL COME!”
A monochrome panel drawn in purple ink shows the ghoulish figure of the jinn looking down on the freed man and Jafara. It has large, pointed ears adorned with hooped earrings; slicked back hair, a tall forehead, and a mouth full of jagged, sharp teeth. “WHO TAMPERS WITH MY SORCERY? WHO REMOVED THE CORD OF MAGIC FROM YOUR LEG?” The jinn demands to know.
