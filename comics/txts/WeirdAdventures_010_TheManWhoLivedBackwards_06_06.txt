A narration box returns us to the city, “HOW LONG I REMAINED AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF, I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING! WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AGAIN, I FOUND MYSELF IN MY CAR IN FRONT OF DAVID’S APARTMENT HOUSE…” Mike looks into Paul’s car and tells him, “I’M SORRY, SIR. YOU CAN’T PARK IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE.” From the car, Paul pleads his case, “BUT I ALWAYS LEAVE MY CAR HERE WHEN I VISIT DAVID BRANT…”
Mike rubs his chin, quizzically, “BRANT? DAVID BRANT? YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN, SIR! THERE’S NO ONE BY THAT NAME LIVING HERE.” Paul leans over to the passenger side window, asking “WHAT IS THIS, A JOKE? OF COURSE HE LIVES HERE!”
A narration box introduces a scene with Paul in the apartment building, saying “PAST THE DOORMAN, I RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED AT THE LISTING OF OCCUPANTS! THERE WAS NO APARTMENT LISTED FOR DAVID BRANT!” Paul stands inside, behind the front doors, reading the directory, and he says, “CAN ALL THAT I’VE GONE THROUGH BE JUST A WEIRD NIGHTMARE? I’LL GO TO PEGGY! SHE’LL UNDERSTAND! I CAN’T BE LOSING MY MIND!”
Peggy waves to Paul as her fiance walks through the door to the apartment. She tells him to leave, “OH, DARLING! YOU SHOULDN’T BE HERE TONIGHT… NOT THE DAY BEFORE OUR WEDDING!” Paul stays, saying “I’VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU, PEGGY! DAVID BRANT GAVE ME A STRANGE DRINK THAT CAUSED ME…”
Peggy cuts Paul off, explaining, “HUSH, DARLING! HOW COULD DAVID HAVE GIVEN YOU A DRINK? YOU KNOW HE WAS KILLED IN THAT ACCIDENT LAST YEAR WHEN YOU TWO WENT HUNTING…” Paul puts a finger to his lip, eyes wide, and looks dumbfounded. He tries again, “LET ME EXPLAIN! WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT I’VE BEEN THROUGH…”
A narration panel interrupts the scene to say, “HOW COULD I EXPLAIN THE STRANGE TIME-PARADOX THROUGH WHICH I HAD JUST LIVED? WOULD PEGGY UNDERSTAND? WOULD ANYONE? FAR WISER TO JUST WRITE IT DOWN. AS I HAVE DONE… AND LEAVE IT AS ONE OF THE WEIRD INEXPLICABLE TWISTS OF FATE!”
Paul embraces Peggy and says, “I… I… FORGIVE ME, DARLING! I WAS JUST OVER-EXCITED, I GUESS!” Peggy, clearly distraught, says, “WE’LL BOTH MISS DAVID… HE WAS SUCH A DEAR FRIEND. BUT AFTER ALL, THE ACCIDENT COULDN’T BE HELPED. AND YOU MISSED SAVING HIM BY THE BAREST SECOND!” THE END.
