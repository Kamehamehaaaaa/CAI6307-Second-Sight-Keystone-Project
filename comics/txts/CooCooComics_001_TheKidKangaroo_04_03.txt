The kangaroo kid swims to a small rock in the pond and smirks confidently, saying, "HE’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO REACH THIS ROCK…" 
The Kangaroo Kid leaps onto the rock with a relieved "PHEW!" His wet fur and tired expression show his effort.
The kangaroo kid is caught off guard and reacts with a surprised "HUH? WOT? AGAIN?" when what he thought was a rock turns out to be a lion who stands up as soon as he sits on it. The lion’s wide eyes add a comedic touch to his disbelief.
The Kangaroo Kid, now running away from the second lion, nervously asks, "WHAT ARE YOU—TWINS?" as the lion growls fiercely, "GR-R-RH! AR-GH!" 
As the Kangaroo Kid is attempting to flee, saying, "I’LL GET BACK TO—OH-OH!" as he reaches the shore only to spot another lion waiting on the shore, the kangaroo kid has a look of dread on his face upon seeing the second lion.
The Kangaroo Kid upon landing on the shore, is shown surprised by a "?" as he notices two more lions staring at him, their expressions menacing. The group of lions, all with identical black manes. The kid is surrounded on all sides by the four lions with the pond behind him, leaving no room for escape.
The Kangaroo Kid, now overwhelmed, cries out "MAMA!" in a desperate plea.
