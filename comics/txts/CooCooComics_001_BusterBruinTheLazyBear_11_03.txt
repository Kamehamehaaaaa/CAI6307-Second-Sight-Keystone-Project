On the roof of his house, Buster Bruin finds the source of the leak. It is a thin stream of water running through the snow. “AHA! SO THAT’S IT!” he exclaims.
Buster Bruin leans over the site of the leak and holds down a wooden plank and nail with one hand. With the other, he holds a hammer high and drives the nail in. The hammer makes the sounds “WHAM!” and “BANG!” as he strikes the nail.
With a “WHAP!”, Buster Bruin crushes one of his fingers with the hammer. His face contorted in pain, and he screams, “YEE-OWWWW!”
Buster Bruin lies in bed with his eyes half-lidded and quite tired. He says, “THAT DOES IT. NOW TO SLEEP TO SPRING!” The hand whose finger he crushed is wrapped in gauze.
Buster Bruin snores, “GARR-GH!” and from someplace unseen emanates the sounds, “CHOP CHOP!”
Buster Bruin wakes up and says, “NOW WHAT- -”, but he is cut off as the sound intensifies, “CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP!”
