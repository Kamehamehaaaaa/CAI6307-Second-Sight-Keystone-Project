The Kangaroo Kid, faces the lion with the thick black mane. His wide-eyed expression and stammered plea, "ER… AREN’T YOU MAKING A M-MISTAKE? SHOULDN’T YOU BE OUT HUNTING T-TIGERS?" The lion with looks at him with a towering stance.
The kangaroo kid quickly says, "NO? EXCUSE ME," and zooms away emitting a "WHOOSE" sound effect. The scene zooms in on the lion, while the kangaroo kid runs away.
The Kangaroo Kid escapes up a tree, sighing "WHEW! SAFE AT LAST!" His tail curled for balance, as he confidently adds, "GOOD THING THAT LION CAN’T CLIMB A TREE-" 
To his surprise as soon as he turns around he sees the lion has climbed up the tree and is sitting on the same branch as him, slowly moving towards him.
The lion then chases the kangaroo kid down the tree with a lot roar, “AARGH!”, the kangaroo kid lets out a “WOW!” As he runs for his life.
The kangaroo kid then jumps into a pond and mutters "LIONS CAN’T SWIM—I HOPE…" The lion comes to an abrupt stop, grunting "OOF!"
