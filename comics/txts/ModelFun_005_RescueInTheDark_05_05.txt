The man in the blue shirt says “FOLLOW IT… SEE WHERE IT LANDS!”. Another man in the group says “I TELL YOU I SAW IT HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION…” and all the men start running in that direction and the third person says “I CAN’T HEAR THE MOTOR ANYMORE.”.
The narrator says that one of the searchers spots a pencil of light pointing upwards out of the flooded weeds and the man in the blue shirt finds it and says “I FOUND IT!”
Rushing out the weeds the man in the blue shirt says “LET’S RUSH THE SERUM OVER TO THE HOSPITAL…”. The other man suggests untapping the serum from the model as they drive towards the hospital and says “WE CAN UNTAPE THE SERUM TUBE AS WE RIDE IN OUR CAR…”. 
In the next panel the man in blue shirt and another man are seen in a car. The other man is untapping the serum from the plane and the blue shirt man says “I JUST FLASHED THE DOC THE GOOD NEWS WITH MY HEADLIGHTS.” And the other man crediting the plane says “LET’S GO… AND THIS LITTLE PLANE DESERVES ALL THE CREDIT!”
The story ends and the conversation is now being continued in the model plane shop where Windy  and his friends were listening to the story. Windy, the storyteller concludes by saying “SO I TELL YOU, BOBBY LIKE THERE’S GOLD IN THEM HILLS, THERE’S PLENTY ADVENTURE IN MODEL PLANES AND FLYING!”. Bobby pointing out the window conveys the fog is lifted and to the model shop owner replies, “HOW ABOUT GETTING OUTDOORS WITH THAT NEW PLANE OF YOURS, BOBBY?”
