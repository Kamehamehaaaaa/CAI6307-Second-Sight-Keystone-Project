John meets Jane on a bench in the park, and narration says, “THAT NIGHT…” John leans into Jane, putting an arm around her shoulder and saying, “JANE, THERE’S SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU - -AND YET, IT’S SO FANTASTIC I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN!” Jane is a bit concerned, saying “IF TELLING ME UPSETS YOU SO, DEAR, YOU DON’T HAVE TO TELL ME!”
John tries to summon the courage, saying “B-BUT YOU MUST KNOW! OH, JANE…” Jane grips his shoulders and leans in even closer, beginning to say “DARLING…” but trailing off.
Zada appears behind the bench while Jane kisses John passionately. Jane cannot see her, but John’s eyes fly wide open.
John breaks his kiss with Jane. She asks, “WHAT - - WHAT IS IT…?”  John points behind Jane, shouting “SHE WAS THERE! STARING AT US!”
A narration box adds, “SUDDENLY…” John gasps, “NO!!” as Zada’s hands, the rest of her unseen, wrap around Jane’s throat from the right of the screen to strangle her.
Zada is shown from behind, her green cape flowing behind the bench, and John tries to stop her from choking Jane, crying, “STOP! STOP! I.. CAN’T GET.. HER HANDS LOOSE…”
“LET HER GO! I’LL GO TO YOUR WORLD! I’LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY!” John caves to Zada’s demands. Zada acknowledges, “VERY WELL, JOHN GRANT…” Below her, Jane sits unconscious on the bench.
