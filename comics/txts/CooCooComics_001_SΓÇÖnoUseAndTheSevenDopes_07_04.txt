A panel with a grey zig-zagging streak and a small X features a yellow narration box explaining, “AND SO S’NO USE STAYS WITH THE SEVEN DOPES AND CLEANS HOUSE AND COOKS FOR THEM..” The box concludes with a ribbon with two knots in it.
S’no Use holds a wooden platter up with one arm calling, “BREAKFAST IS READY!” A dope complains, “OMIGOSH! BURNT TOAST AGAIN” Another adds, “SHE SURE MAKES ROTTEN COFFEE!” Another continues, “I’M STILL SICK FROM YESTERDAY’S MEALS!” A final complaint says, “BOYS, WE’LL HAVE TO GET RID OF HER BEFORE HER COOKING KILLS US!”
A small box indicates a transition, “LATER..” One of the dopes holds a long scroll before a tree where a blue bird perches. The dope says, “I WANT TO INSERT THIS AD IN YOUR MORNING GOSSIP!” The bird assents “SURE, DOPE! I’LL START TO GOSSIP AT ONCE. WOT’S TH’ DIRT?” A sign beneath his feet, hanging from the branch he stands on, names the bird “B. BLUE JAY ALL THE GOSSIP ALL TH’ TIME!”
Puffing his chest out and wearing a pair of round glasses, B. Blue Jay caws the ad placed in his gossip, “WANTED - A PRINCE CHARMING FOR S’NO USE! SHE IS AT THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN DOPES… APPLY AT ONCE - - NO REFERENCES NEEDED, EVEN…”
A man in a green cap and orange tunic rides up to a tree on a horse covered in a yellow sheet with a couple of customs stamps on it. He asks his horse, “HM- AN AD! SHOULD WE INQUIRE?” The horse replies, “I’LL TOSS YOU FER IT.” The sign reads “WANTED! A PRICE WOT IS CHARMING ETC ETC ALSO ‘ ALSO ‘ ETC ‘“
The man lands kicking up dust and shakes his head violently, saying “OKAY - YOU TOSSED ME FOR IT! NOW LET’S INQUIRE.”
