From the sidewalk, Jane cries out helplessly, “EEEEE! JOHN!” A crowd of people gather on either side of the street. One shouts, “THAT CAR! IT’S GOING TO RUN OVER HIM!” John has fallen into the car’s path and is less than a body length from being run over.
The woman from before appears behind John and shoots the car with a kind of ray gun, going “Z-ZAPP!” John looks back at her, and the gun leaves a golden yellow goo all over the car’s hood.
The car has been stopped. Jane kneels in the road to attend to John and asks, “JOHN! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?” John stutters, “Y-Yes!” In the background, a man in a grey trenchcoat and fedora stands, mouth agape, among the shocked and bewildered crowd, “A MIRACLE! IF THAT LIGHTNING BOLT HADN’T HIT THE CAR…” The car between the crowd and John and Jane is covered with the yellowish substance from the mystery woman’s ray gun, which resembles melted wax.
Relieved, John realizes what just happened, “IT - - IT WASN’T A LIGHTNING BOLT THAT HIT THE CAR, JANE! SHE DID IT… WITH A RAY GUN!” He holds his hat in one hand, and Jane clings to his arm trying to console him, “RAY GUN? OH, YOU MUST HAVE IMAGINED IT!”
John places a hand to his temple and thinks, “HOW CAN I EXPECT HER TO BELIEVE WHAT I SAW… OR DID I REALLY SEE IT?” Jane tells him, “YOU GO RIGHT HOME AND LIE DOWN FOR A WHILE, DARLING!”
“Later…”, the narration indicates. John lies in bed without his coat or tie on but not completely undressed. He wonders, “I CAN’T GET THAT STRANGE GIRL OUT OF MY MIND! DID I REALLY SEE HER DEMOLISH THAT CAR WITH A RAY GUN, OR WAS IT ALL A HALLUCINATION?”
