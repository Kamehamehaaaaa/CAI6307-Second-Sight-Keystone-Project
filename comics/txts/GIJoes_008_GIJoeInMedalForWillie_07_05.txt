Pete, clad in a roughed up green uniform and helmet, crouches behind a bush, says, "MAYBE IF I CAN’T GET THROUGH THAT LINE! BUT I CAN GET THOSE BOZOS TO FIRE THEIR GUNS, THE SCOUTS FROM BAKER COMPANY WILL KNOW SOMETHING IS UP!" Enemy tanks loom in the background, their dark silhouettes menacing against a fiery sky.
Sudden action erupts as Pete hurls a grenade, the explosion marked by a fiery "BLAMMM!” that lights up the scene, sending shockwaves through the air. 
A narration "THEN STARTS A FANTASTIC ‘BULLFIGHT’ WITH THE STEEL MONSTERS SNORTING AFTER THIS ELUSIVE TOREADOR…", shows Pete in a daring dance with the tanks, another explosion, ”BLAMMMM!" rocking a tank.
Pete exclaims in a taunt, "I GOT FOUR GRENADES LEFT, THEN… COME ON, BABIES! COME TO PAPA! AND LET’S HEAR THOSE GUNS LOUD AND GOOD!" His figure is small but resolute against the steel giants. 
The scene shifts to the skirmish line, where the narration describes, "MEANWHILE, AT THE SCENE OF THE SKIRMISH, A DIRTY, BEDRAGGLED, EXHAUSTED FIGURE HURTLES ACROSS THE LINE…" A soldier, Burch, stumbles forward, his uniform torn, shouting, "CAP’N… CAP’N KING, THERE’S TANKS - - RED TANKS - - FLANK ATTACK!" as Captain King exclaims, “BURCH! GOOD MAN! JACKSON, BRING ME A FIELD PHONE! JOE, WHERE ARE THEY?" against a backdrop of smoke and gunfire. Burch, surrounded by soldiers with a red cross medical box, urgently relays coordinates into a field phone: "HELLO, ARTILLERY, RANGE THREE-FIVE-SEVEN-ZERO VECTORS C-30 AND D-30! FIRE AT WILL!" A soldier with blonde hair, his helmet off, a bandage on his forehead, is told, "MAN, ARE YOU LUCKY THAT BULLET JUST GRAZED YOUR HEAD!" The soldier, still dazed, replies, "YEAH! I MUSTA BEEN OUT COLD FOR TEN MINUTES!"
