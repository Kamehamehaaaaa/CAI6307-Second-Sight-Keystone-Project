Al looking down the Argus office window and pointing down says “WE BETTER HAND THIS OVER TO DYKES. HE THINKS WE DID IT. ONE OF HIS MEN IS DOWNSTAIRS WATCHING US.” Nick disagrees with it and says they use this for publicity of their agency and moving his hands towards the phone he says “OH NO! WE’LL SOLVE THIS CASE OURSELVES. WHAT PUBLICITY! I’LL CALL FRED AT THE BANK”
 Nick on call “YOU’LL CALL ME IF ANYBODY TRIES TO WITHDRAW THE ACCOUNT. I’LL HAVE AL WATCH YOUR BANK. THANKS, FRED”
 As Al was about to take up his watching post at the bank, Inspector Dykes jumps to the scene and catching Al by the shoulder says “HELLO AL! I KNEW YOU’D COME SOONER OR LATER. YOU’RE UNDER ARREST” Al in a confused voice says “BUT BUT YOU ARE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!”
 Tipped off by Fred about Al’s arrest Nick is seen laying on a sofa at the young boy’s house and the young boy offers to help Nick and says “MOM SAYS YOU CAN STAY WITH US ‘TILL YOU SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. CAN I HELP, NICK?” Nick is grateful and says “THANKS, PETER I WON'T BE HERE LONG.”
 Narrator describes that Nick sneaks into the Miser’s home to question the janitor Carl at night. Nick and Carl are seen sitting on a table and Nick asks Carl “NO ONE EVER VISITED THE OLD GEEZER? WHO BROUGHT HIM HIS FOOD, CARL?” To which Carl replied “AN OLD CRONY OF HIS, CAME TWICE A WEEK WITH GRUB. DIDN’T SHOW UP TODAY, THOUGH”
 Several days have passed, says the narrator. The young boy and Nick are talking in the street. The young boy says “MAYBE THE OLD MISER’S FRIEND DID IT AND SKIPPED, NICK?” Nick replies “POSSIBLE. BUT HOW COME NO ONE EVER SAW HIM EXCEPT CARL?”
