 “I’LL KILL YOU, ANNA!” Joe shouts, pointing his gun at her as she stands on the edge of the roof. She gasps,gripping her arm, “NO! NO! YOUR OWN SISTER!” From the door to the roof, the police emerge brandishing tommyguns. One policeman orders, “DROP THOSE GUNS, YOU GUYS! DROP ‘EM!” 
Joe shouts, “COPS! BLAST ‘EM! OHHHHH!”  He is cut off as bullets from one of the police tommyguns tear through his and his accomplice’s bodies. The shooting policeman says, “LET ‘EM HAVE IT, PETE!”
The dead bodies of Joe and his accomplice in the green suit fall over the rooftop railing, knocking the machine down with them. Anna shouts, “THE MACHINE!! SAVE THE MACHINE!!” One police man realizes it’s hopeless, “NO USE! THOSE TWO GUYS AND THAT GADGET ARE GONE FOR GOOD!”
“BUT AT THAT MOMENT-!” A narration box says.  “HEY! A BREEZE! BOY, SMELL THAT FRESH AIR!” one policeman smiles. “THE- DOME! IT’S GONE!”, another looks up. Anna buries her face into his arm crying, “OH, LARS - LARS! IT’S ALL OVER!”
Finally, a narration box says, “SEVERAL DAYS LATER…” Anna, with her arm in a sling speaks to Swede from the couch of a hospital room. He lays in bed gauze over his forehead and jaw. “THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU’LL BE FINE, LARS! AND THE POLICE WON’T ARREST US… THEY SAY YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE TO SAVE THE CITY AND - “ The Mayor is sitting right of her on the couch. He cuts her off, “YOU BOTH RISKED YOUR LIVES!” Swede grunts from the bed, “BUT THE MACHINE IS GONE!”
Anna leans over her husband and drapes an arm over his shoulder and beneath his neck in the bed. She says, “IF MR. KEMAL COULD MAKE SUCH A MACHINE… PERHAPS SOMEONE ELSE CAN, LARS! AND THEN IT WILL BE USED FOR GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL!” The two look into each other’s eyes and smile. THE END.
