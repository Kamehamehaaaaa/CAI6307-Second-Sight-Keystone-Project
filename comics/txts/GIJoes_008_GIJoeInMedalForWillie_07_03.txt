A narration at the top sets the scene: "SO, WHILE ‘BAKER’ COMPANY IS IN SKIRMISH WITH INFILTRATING RED PATROLS…" 
Two soldiers in uniforms and helmets, lay communication wires amidst the danger. One soldier, gripping a roll of wire, thinks, "I WISH I WAS OVER THERE WITH THE BOYS! I AIN’T NEVER GOIN’ TO WIN NO MEDALS LAYIN’ WIRE! NUTS!" while his comrade, focused on the task, responds, "HOLD UP A SECOND WHILE I SNIP THAT BARBED WIRE…" 
A moment of alarm arises as they spot a cloud of dust on the horizon. The soldier pointing at the cloud of dust exclaims, "YEAH, I’LL… JOE! LOOK! THAT CLOUD OF DUST! TANKS!" and his partner adds, "I SEE ‘EM! THE REDS MUST BE TRYIN’ TO SNEAK AN ARMORED SPEARHEAD IN TO BREAK THE SKIRMISH LINE! WE GOTTA WARN THE COMPANY!" 
Joe, with a look of determination, decides, "LISTEN, JOE I’LL GO…" but Pete, knowing the risks, insists, "NO, PETE! I KNOW YOU. THE QUICKEST WAY IS THROUGH THE RED FLANK! YOU GET OUT OF HERE, BUT FAST. IF THOSE TANKS SPOT YOU, YOU’RE A GONER! HEAD BACK FOR CAMP!" 
A soldier watches Pete’, noting, "THE RED FLANK PATROL CUTS RIGHT THROUGH THERE—HEY! HE’S GONNA TRY TO INFILTRATE THEIR LINE!" as Pete, rifle in hand, dashes toward enemy territory. 
Enemy soldiers in darker uniforms, speaking in Japanese. their silhouettes framed against a fiery red sky, signals imminent danger.  The final panel erupts with action as gunfire sounds, "RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT…" and Pete, caught in the crossfire, cries out, "OHHHHHH!" jumping up while dropping his rifle.
