A narration box continues, “WHILE THEY MAYOR OF MIDWEST CITY RECEIVES A PHONE CALL -” From his desk, the Mayor shouts over the phone, “A MILLION DOLLARS IN SMALL BILLS?!!” YOU’RE MAD! LISTEN TO ME! I PROMISE YOU’LL GET THE MONEY… BUT THINK WHAT YOU’RE DOING? PEOPLE ARE DYING…!” The voice over the phone replies, “THE MONEY FIRST, PAL… OR THE DOME STAYS ON!”
Tugging at his collar, the Mayor pleads with the voice on the phone, “IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY, WHOEVER YOU ARE… STOP THIS HORROR! I PROMISE YOU - -HELLO! HELLO!... HE HUNG UP!” The phone says, “CLICK!”
“AND MEANWHILE”, more narration indicates the transition to Swede and Anna in there home. “OH, ANNA, ANNA! ALL THIS IS MY FAULT! MINE! AND I’M AFRAID TO TELL ABOUT THE MACHINE! IF SOMEONE BROKE IT… THE DOME MIGHT STAY… FOREVER! IF ONLY I COULD FIND THOSE MEN WITH THE RING!” Anna places a hand around her husband’s waist while he doubles over in an armchair in their living room. Outside the scene of chaos unfolds without them. She says, “I KNOW, LARS… I KNOW! BUT THEY WERE STRANGERS!”
Swede grips his wife by the shoulders and shouts, “NO! THAT’S IT! IT WAS - -REMEMBER KEMAL SAID NO ONE KNOW BUT US? AND THE MAN WHO HIT ME CALLED ME SWEDE! IT WAS JOE, ANNA! HE OVERHEARD US TALKING AND - -WHERE IS HE, ANNA!? WHERE IS HE!?” Anna doubts it, “HE JUST WENT OUT… BUT LARS… NOT JOE!”
Swede runs out of the front door to his home, saying “YES, ANNA! I’M SORRY HE’S YOUR BROTHER - BUT THERE’S NO ONE ELSE IT COULD BE! I’LL FOLLOW HIM… GET THE TRUTH OUT OF HIM!” Anna follows Swede out of the house, saying “I’M GOING WITH YOU! IT’S NO USE ARGUING! I’M GOING!”
In the background Anna and Swede stand speaking. Anna says, “IF HE DID THIS I WANT HIM TO GET PUNISHED! I - I CAN’T CONSIDER HIM MY BROTHER!” Swede replies, “GOOD GIRL, ANNA! LOOK! THERE HE GOES! WE’LL FOLLOW HIM… FIND HIS PARTNER!” In the foreground a business stands with its windows smashed; people wander the street aimlessly; and a dog sniffs a knocked-over trash can. One of the figures, walking toward the viewer, is clearly Joe.
