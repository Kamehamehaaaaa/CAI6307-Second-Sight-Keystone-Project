A box narrates the toast, “IRRESISTIBLY, I MOVED BACKWARD UNTIL ONCE AGAIN I WAS FACING DAVID… DRINKING HIS TOAST TO MINE AND PEGGY’S HAPPINESS!” The two men raise a glass, but the expression on Paul’s face this time is one of deep concern. Desperately, he thinks to himself, “DAVID! DAVID! HELP ME! I CAN SEE YOU LIPS MOVE… I REMEMBER YOUR WORDS… BUT EVERYTHING IS BACKWARDS! EVERY SOUND! HELP ME, DAVID! HELP ME!”
On the table between them, David pours the drinks for the the toast they just shared. Paul thinks, “YOUR EYES, DAVID! MALICIOUS! FULL OF HATRED! I DIDN’T SEE IT BEFORE, DAVID!.. YOU HATE ME! YOU DID THIS THING TO ME! WHY? WHY? - -”
A narration box continues, “BEFORE I COULD FIND THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION MY MIND ASKED, TIME SWEPT ME BACKWARDS! I WAS OUT OF THE APARTMENT THROUGH THE DOOR, IN MY CAR AGAIN!”
On the street, Paul thinks to himself, “DAVID DID THIS TO ME? BUT WHY? WHY DID HE DOOM ME TO THIS HORROR?”
Sweating, Paul wipes his brow and keeps pondering, “DON’T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF A CRASH! THE CAR WILL RETRACE ITS ROUTE FROM DAVID’S HOUSE. BUT WHAT’S TO BECOME OF ME IN THE END? AM I TO KEEP LIVING BACKWARDS UNTIL I BECOME A CHILD AGAIN?”
An orange narration box continues, “LIFE BECAME AN AGONY TO ME! I WENT TO SLEEP IN THE MORNING, AWOKE AT NIGHT… LIVED THE DAYS THROUGH, BACKWARDS IN A SWEEP OF HELPLESS DESPAIR AND HORROR!” Paul stands in his home with no hat or suit on, either putting on or taking off his coat and thinks hard, “WHEN DID THIS START? HOW MANY DAYS OF WEEKS HAVE I LIVED BACKWARDS? WHEN I WAKE UP IS IT GOING TO BE TOMORROW OR YESTERDAY?”
Sitting up in bed, with a night shirt on, Paul has just woken up in the night. He closes his eyes and thinks dejectedly, “I’LL NEVER REACH THE END OF THIS GHASTLY TERROR! I’LL LOSE MY MIND FIRST!”
Walking backward through a door, Paul begins to hope, “PERHAPS I CAN KEEP FROM LOSING MY MIND ALTOGETHER IF I REMEMBER WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE DAY! LET ME SEE… WHAT WILL I LIVE OVER AGAIN… AH! PEGGY! AND OUR ENGAGEMENT!”
