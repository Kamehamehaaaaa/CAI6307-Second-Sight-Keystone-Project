Lester, the mischievous lamb, finds himself under a permanent wave machine. His curiosity quickly turns to alarm when he sniffs suspiciously and mutters, "WHO’S SMOKING THOSE ROTTEN CIGARS?" Realizing the danger, he panics, shouting, "YEOW! IT’S ME! I’M ON FIRE! HELP!" as smoke billows from the machine. Lester leaps out, yelling, "FIRE! HELP!" while the horrified stylist cries, "MY MACHINE! HE’S RUINED!" In a frantic attempt to "STOP IT!" the stylist douses Lester with a fire extinguisher, spraying foam everywhere as Lester lets out an "AHH… H… H…" of effort amidst the chaos.
Covered in foam, Lester bolts out of the parlor with an "OOF!" and a stern "STAY OUT!" warning echoing behind him. Mary, utterly furious, storms after him, scolding, "I WAS NEVER SO EMBARRASSED IN MY LIFE, LESTER! YOU’RE A DISGRACE!" as they march down the street. Lester, trailing behind with a sheepish grin, tries to lighten the mood with a playful bleat, "I’M A BAA… AD BOY!" The episode wraps up with Lester’s cheeky admission, leaving us laughing at his knack for turning a simple haircut into an uproarious disaster!
