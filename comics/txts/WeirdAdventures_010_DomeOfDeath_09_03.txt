A narration box begins, “SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE DAWN, ON THE ROOF OF THE ARROW BUILDING -” The monochrome figures of Mr. Kemal, Swede and Anna stand in azure moonlight by the controls of a machine. Mr. Kemal comments, “THERE! IN A MOMENT, THE DOME WILL BE FORMED OVER THE CITY - !” Looking at Mr. Kemal, Swede asks, “YOU KEEP THE FORMULA FOR OPERATING THE MACHINE IN THAT RING ON YOUR FINGER, MR. KEMAL?!”
From out of sight, Mr. Kemal holds out his hands. From the one with the ring, he sticks out his ring finger and with the other he opens the gem insert and places the secret component back into his ring. He explains, “YES! I KEEP THE SECRET IN THIS RING!” Swede and Anna look up to the sky, but Anna says, “MR. KEMAL, I - I DON’T SEE ANYTHING IN THE SKY!”
Mr. Kemal squints smuggly saying, “OF COURSE NOT - IT’S INVISIBLE! BUT BELIEVE ME, THIS CITY IS COVERED BY AN ABSOLUTELY IMPENETRABLE DOME OF FORCE! NOTHING AND NO ONE CAN BREAK IT! Anna’s head turns as if on a swivel. From a place unseen to the right of them, a voice orders, “THAT’S JUST FINE PROFESSOR! NOW HAND OVER THE RING LIKE A GOOD BOY!”
In high contrast yellow monochrome lighting, Mr. Kemal, Swede and Anna are confronted by two men wearing fedoras, suits and bandanas masking their faces. They hold the trio at gunpoint “THE RING? YOU CAN’T! YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND!” Mr. Kemal pleads. One of them replies, “WE UNDERSTAND ENOUGH TO KNOW THIS OLD JOKER’S GOT THE TOWN RIGHT WHERE WE WANT IT! HAND IT OVER, POP!”
Mr. Kemal flees through the open door behind the men, shouting madly, “I’LL NEVER LET YOU USE MY INVENTION! AA-AAA!” One of the men, in a blue suit, turns to shoot Mr. Kemal in the back as he flees, saying “IF THAT’S THE WAY YOU WANT IT, PROFESSOR!” The other man, seen only in silhouette against the wall, orders, “YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, ‘SWEDE’!”
The man in the blue suit reaches down and grabs the ring on Mr. Kemal’s hand saying, “NOW WE’LL JUST TAKE THAT RING, AND - -” Swede resists the other man, who wears a green suit, yelling “YOU DIRTY SKUNKS!”
The green suited villain pistol whips Swede saying, “I TOLD YA TO STAY OUT OF IT!” Swede cries “UH-H!” Anna screams, “OHHH! DON’T!”
