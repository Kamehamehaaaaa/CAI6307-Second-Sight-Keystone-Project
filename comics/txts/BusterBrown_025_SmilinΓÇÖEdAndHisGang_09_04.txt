The story unfolds on a steep, snow-covered mountain under a pale yellow sky, where Smilin' Ed and his gang—Froggy the Gremlin, Midnight the Cat, Squeaky the Mouse, and the man in the blue climbing outfit—are roped together, clinging to the icy slope. The group is in the midst of their ascent when a large red eagle swoops down, its wings spread wide, declaring with a speech bubble, "I’M AN EAGLE, I AM, I AM!" Froggy, the large frog in his red polka-dotted climbing outfit, is caught in the eagle’s talons, his expression a mix of surprise and defiance as he wrestles with the bird. Midnight the Cat, in her small black climbing outfit with a red bow tie, and Squeaky the Mouse, in his yellow and black striped shirt, are yanked off the mountain by the force of the eagle’s attack, their limbs flailing as they dangle from the rope. The eagle’s assault culminates in a dramatic "YOWPPP!!" as Froggy manages to fend it off, sending the bird flying away in a flurry of feathers.
The commotion causes the group to lose their grip, and they begin to slide down the mountain. Smilin' Ed, the stout man with a mustache, dressed in his red and black climbing outfit with a green hat, is at the top of the group, still holding onto the mountain with his ice pick. He looks down with concern, his speech bubble reading, "MY GOOTNESS, SMILIN' ED, DID YOU SCHLIPP?" The man in the blue outfit, now in a gray climbing ensemble with a red hat and scarf, is just below him, looking shaken but unharmed. He responds with a speech bubble that says, "SMILIN' ED—ARE YOU HURT?" Froggy, still tangled in the rope, grins despite the chaos, his speech bubble saying, "NO, BUT I THINK I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF MOUNTAIN CLIMBING—WE’LL NEVER REACH THE TOP!"
As the group continues to slide down the snowy slope, they spot a large mountain goat with curved horns standing on a nearby ledge. Froggy, ever the optimist, waves enthusiastically, calling out with a speech bubble, "HELLO, MR. BIG HORN!" The man in the gray outfit, still sliding, looks at the goat with a mix of hope and desperation, his speech bubble reading, "WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK!" Froggy, however, has a mischievous idea, his speech bubble declaring, "I’M GONNA BUTT SOMEBODY!" The man in gray, sensing Froggy’s plan, responds with a speech bubble that says, "IF YOU GOTTA BUTT SOMEONE, THERE’S SOMEONE WHO IS NICE AN’ SOFT!" The group’s slide comes to a stop as they approach the mountain goat, setting the stage for a humorous confrontation.
