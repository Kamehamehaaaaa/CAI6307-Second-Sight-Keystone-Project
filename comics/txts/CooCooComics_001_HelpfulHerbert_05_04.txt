Herbert, the portly man in a suit and hat, tosses a life preserver, shouting "GRAB IT, LADY!" to save a drowning woman. 
A muscular man is seen accusing, "AHA!—SO WE GOT A TIRE THIEF AROUND HERE—HEY!!" near the car, adding a comedic misunderstanding.
The rescued woman, in a red swimsuit, is seen gratefully saying, "OH, THANK YOU SIR! YOU SAVED MY LIFE!" while Herbert modestly replies, "DON’T MENTION IT, LADY-" 
Her admiration is captured, "YOU ARE A REAL HERO!— I DON’T KNOW HOW I CAN EVER—REPAY YOU”, to which Herbert modestly replies, “AW, SHUCKS! — IT WAS NOTHIN’!!" as Herbert downplays his deed. 
The woman exclaims, "YOU WONDERFUL MAN!!" and plants a loud "SMACK!" kiss on his forehead, leaving him flustered. 
Herbert is seen beaming, cigar in mouth and stars circling his head, reveling in the unexpected praise.
