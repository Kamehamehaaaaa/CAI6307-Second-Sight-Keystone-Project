In a dramatic wartime comic, the top left panel depicts a tense moment as Pvt. Pinto delivers a powerful punch to Lulu, who sits on a chair, her red hat flying off with a "BOP!" sound effect as stars burst around her, indicating the impact. Pvt. Pinto, in his army uniform, stands over her, saying, "NEVER HIT A WOMAN IN MY LIFE, BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES…" his face stern as the camp’s background, with tents and a bench, frames the scene. The top right panel shows Pvt. Pinto dashing away, shouting, "BULL’S EYE! NOW TO SEE THE SCORE!" as he leaves Lulu reeling, her body slumped from the blow, the sky above a soft blue, adding contrast to the action.
In the middle left panel, Pvt. Pinto confronts Lulu, pointing accusingly as he declares, "A WIG! JUST AS I THOUGHT! YOU’RE NOT MY LULU—YOU’RE A SPY IN DISGUISE… A NASTY SPY!" Lulu, now revealed to be wearing a wig, sits on the ground with her blonde hairpiece off, exposing her true identity, her red dress and pearls still in place as she looks up in shock. The middle right panel captures Lulu’s distress as she clutches her head, crying, "BAH! MY SABOTAGE CAREER IS OVER!" while Pvt. Pinto retorts, "YOU’RE KIDDIN’, NOT BROTHER!" his expression fierce as they face off on a grassy field with bushes in the background.
The bottom left panel shows the sergeant rushing toward Lulu, who stands dazed with stars around her head, exclaiming, "WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS ESCORTIN’ HER ‘ROUND THE POST!" as Pvt. Pinto stands nearby, looking determined. The camp’s tents and hills stretch into the distance, grounding the scene in a military setting. In the bottom right panel, Pvt. Pinto grabs Lulu by the arm, pulling her along as she protests, "THIS IS GONNA BE HER LAST ESCORT ‘ROUND ANY POST… AND IT AIN’T A HARM!" her blonde wig now fully off, revealing her true hair as she stumbles. Pvt. Pinto responds with a resolute, "WELL, I’LL BE!" his face set with determination as they move toward an uncertain fate, the background fading into a simple gradient.
