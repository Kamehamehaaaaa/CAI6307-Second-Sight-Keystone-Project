 A narration box begins, “THE NEWS SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE CITY…” Below it, a city street is packed with a crowd of people looking up into the sky. One man in the foreground reads the front page of a newspaper with the headline, “MIDWEST CITY IMPRISONED BENEATH INVISIBLE TI… POLICE TO TRY EXPLOSIVES”
Within the barrier, a regiment of policemen shoot at the barrier while an explosion rocks it further afield. One with a helmet says, “THERE GOES THE DYNAMITE!” Another with a cap on says, dejected, “IT’S NO USE! DOESN’T AFFECT IT, AT ALL! WE’RE TRAPPED!”
Another narration box says, “AND, AS THE NEWS REACHES THE OUTSIDE WORLD -” In the foreground a greying, highly-decorated military officer speaks on the phone, “GET THE NATIONAL GUARD DOWN THERE… TELL ‘EM TO TAKE ARTILLERY! ALERT THE AIR FORCE! WE MUST BREAK INTO THAT CITY BEFORE THE PEOPLE PANIC -!” In the background two men watch from a set of communications equipment.
Soldiers in full uniform march in single file toward the invisible dome alongside a line of heavy artillery. Above them planes soar toward their target.
Inside the barrier, there is chaos. A building is on fire in the background, and firemen work to put the blaze out. Two police men remark, “SURE THEY’RE LOOTING, BUT WHAT CAN WE DO? THERE AREN’T ENOUGH OF US COPS TO - -” and “THERE’S NO WATER! THAT INVISIBLE THING BLOCKED THE SUPPLIES FROM THE RESERVOIR THE WHOLE CITY WILL BURN DOWN IF WE CAN’T - -” Further in the background, a crowd of people run farther away to a more distant building; in the foreground there is another crowd, some watch the destruction, others turn away, and one man shouts into the air.
