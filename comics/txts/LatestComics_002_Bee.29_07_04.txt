In a vibrant, wartime comic scene, a farmer in red overalls and a straw hat leads a captured Japanese spy, who is in a suit, toward the sheriff, gripping his arm firmly while bees buzz around them in support. The farmer praises the lead bee, saying, "NICE WORK, B-29! TO THE SHERIFF, JAP!" as they walk along a path with trees and hills in the background. Bee 29, marked with the number 29 on its chest and wearing a blue cape, rallies the group with urgency, declaring, "WE GOTTA GET STARTED! THE GERM-CARRYING FLIES ARE DUE AT TWO," referring to the enemy’s earlier revealed plan to release deadly flies at 2:00 to spread mortal germs.
The scene shifts as Bee 29 organizes a clever trap, instructing the other bees, "PUT THE SIGNS PAPER HERE AND PUT THE HONEY ON THICK!" They set up a series of enticing signs like "FLY'S REST," "HOW FAR CAN A FLY FLY?" and "SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR FLIES," alongside a large pot labeled "HONEY" with a rolled-up paper nearby, all designed to lure the enemy flies with sticky sweetness. The sky above is dotted with clouds, and the ground is scattered with small details like a thumbs-up sign, adding to the playful tone. Bee 29, now buzzing with excitement, shouts, "HERE THEY COME! LET’S HIDE!" as a swarm of enemy flies approaches from the sky, their dark forms contrasting against the bright background.
The enemy flies, drawn in by the setup, appear delighted as one exclaims, "ARE YOU TIRED HUNGRY? RELAX HONEY IN HONEYLAND!" while another adds, "SOUNDS GREAT! MUST BE HEAVEN!" as they eagerly descend toward the honey, completely unaware of the bees’ scheme to trap them and thwart their germ-spreading mission. The comic blends wartime strategy with whimsical humor, portraying the bees as cunning defenders using honey and trickery to stop the enemy.
