Swede’s wife lets another man, with a bald cranium that still has some hair around the edges, into their home, introducing him, “IT’S MR. KEMAL AGAIN, LARS! HE WANTS TO KNOW IF WE’VE… MADE UP OUR MINDS!” Mr. Kemal greets the other men, “GOOD EVENING, SIRS!” Swede points with his thumb at Joe, telling him to leave, “JOE, DO YOU MIND… THIS IS BUSINESS!” “OKAY, OKAY!” Joe sighs rising from the couch he had been laying on and dropping the paper he’d been reading to the floor.
Mr. Kemal sits in a red armchair. Swede begins, “MR. KEMAL, I DON’T THINK I - -” Resting his elbow on the arm of the chair, Mr. Kemal explains his proposition, “PLEASE, MR. SWENSON… REMEMBER, I’M OFFERING YOU TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CASH! AND IT’S FOR THE GOOD… PERHAPS THE VERY SURVIVAL OF HUMANITY!”
Mr. Kemal explains in harsh light, the features of his face casting long shadows across it, and lifting the hand he was resting on the chair before, a ring with a large red gem inset on his ring finger, “LET ME EXPLAIN IT AGAIN! I HAVE INVENTED A MACHINE WHICH CAN THROW AN IMPENATRABLE SCREEN OF FORCE AROUND ANY GIVEN AREA! NOTHING CAN PIERCE IT - NOTHING! IT WOULD BE PERFECT PROTECTION FOR CITY IN CASE OF AN ATOMIC ATTACK! BUT THE GOVERNMENT LAUGHS AT ME! THEREFORE, I MUST ARRANGE TO PROVE TO THEM THAT MY MACHINE WORKS!”
He continues, “LET ME SET MY MACHINE ON TOP OF THE ARROW BUILDING LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THERE IS LITTLE TRAFFIC IN OR OUT OF TOWN! I’LL SET UP THE SCREEN, THEN CALL THE GOVERNMENT MEN TO TEST IT! PLEASE, MR. SWENSON! THINK OF WHAT SUCH A PROTECTIVE DEVICE COULD DO FOR THE SAFETY OF THIS COUNTRY!” Swede spreads his arms out and questions, “BUT - IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG…!” His wife simply watches in the background, wearing an expression of concern and disbelief.
Mr. Kemal leers standing up, “NO ONE BUT YOU KNOWS ABOUT MY PLAN! NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY GO WRONG!” Swede’s wife says, “I - I DON’T LIKE IT!” Swede begins to come around to the idea, “BUT ANNA! TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IT WOULD MEAN COLLEGE FOR THE BOY, THE MUSIC LESSONS LITTLE HILDA WANTS SO MUCH…”
His wife, Anna, agrees nervously, “IF - -IF YOU’RE SURE THERE’S NO DANGER…” Mr. Kemal and her husband stand with her in the otherwise vacant living room.
