The scene takes place in a room with a warm fireplace in the background, emitting a soft orange glow with visible flames. To the left, there’s a blue armchair with a fringed edge, and on the right, a green cushioned bench where a black cat with a red bow tie sits. A floor lamp with a simple shade stands near the armchair, and a round rug with a yellow center covers the floor.
In the center of the image, three main characters are gathered. The first is a stout man with a mustache, wearing a blue cap, a brown suit with black stripes, and a matching vest. He’s gesturing with his right hand raised and has a speech bubble that says, "JA! UND SMILIN' ED, I AM GOING TO TAKE ON A TRIB ZUN VALLEY. HOLLY SMOKE- HOUSE, VILL YOU HAVE FUN! SKIING UND MOUNTAIN CLIMBING UND SCHTUFF LIKE DOT!" Next to him is a large, cheerful frog character dressed in a colorful outfit with polka dots and a bow tie, holding a small mouse with a yellow and black striped shirt. The frog has a speech bubble that reads, "MOUNTAIN CLIMBING IS EASY FOR SMILIN' ED. HE COMES FROM A LONG LINE OF GOATS, HE DOES!" The third character is a well-dressed man in a blue suit with a red tie, standing with his hands behind his back, smiling confidently. He has a speech bubble that says nothing in this panel.
To the right, the black cat with a red bow tie is perched on the bench, looking up with a speech bubble that reads, "WELL, GOLLY, THAT'S FINE, MR. TRAVELLER. WE'LL LEAVE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!" Below the cat, a smaller speech bubble from an unseen speaker says, "NICE!"
At the bottom of the panel, there’s a scroll-like text box with the following narration: "SMILIN' ED AND HIS FRIENDS, FROGGY THE GREMLIN, MIDNIGHT THE CAT AND SQUEAKY THE MOUSE, ACCEPT MR. TRAVELLER'S INVITATION TO TAKE A VACATION AT THE FAMOUS WINTER RESORT KNOWN AS SUN VALLEY..."
