The burglar in a cap and scarf marvels, "AMAZING!!" as Sniffy performs a handstand trick, his tail wagging. 
The burglar is seen clapping, "ATTA BOY! BUT I DIDN’T COME HERE TO SEE A ACT! I GOT TO WORK TO DO!!" with a "CLAP!" sound effect, while Sniffy performs a trick of balancing a book on his nose.
The burglar rummages through a drawer, muttering, "HMM… NOTHIN’ HERE… WHAT’S UP, PAL?" while Sniffy barks, "ARF!" Signaling yes. 
The burglar’s delight is captured as Sniffy fetches silverware, exclaiming, "WELL, WHADDAYA KNOW! THE SILVERWARE! KNOW WHERE THEY KEEP THE JEWELS, MAC?" with Sniffy responding, "ARF!”
The burglar, impressed, exclaims, "MAR-VELL-OUS! SMATTER… DON’T THEY FEED YOU GOOD HERE?" as Sniffy stands pointing to his left.
The burglar, wide-eyed, declares, "WELL, I’LL BE… HE’S BRINGIN’ ME FAMILY HEIRLOOMS!" as Sniffy brings in a white box.
