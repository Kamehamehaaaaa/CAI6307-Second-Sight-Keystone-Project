Kala swims rapidly through turbulent waters back to the village on Bandara Island. He darts into the hut of the leader and his son, who Chad and Kala saved before. The man speaks, “AHA, YOU LITTLE GOOD FELLA! WHERE BIG GOOD FELLA? YOU FIX UP LITTLE SON! GET GOOD WELL! ME YOU FRIEND!” The son waves from a mat on the floor. Kala, standing int he doorway, explains the situation on the Swift and asks for their help, “GOOD! YOU BE MY FRIEND TONIGHT! HELP KILL BAD FELLA! HELP BIG GOOD FELLA… HEY?”
A narration box signals a transition in scene, “MEANWHILE ON THE ‘SWIFT’” Ham Stone grabs Chad’s blue hair and raises a fist as if to strike the other man, seated in and tied to the back of a chair with a brown cord. Beau Dillion interrogates him, “OKAY, BILLOW, WHAT IS THE TREASURE ON THE ‘ISLAND QUEEN’? WHERE IS IT?” Chad refuses to give him the answers, “YOU’RE WASTEING YOUR TIME I WON’T TALK!”
At the same time, Kala explains to a group of buff tribesmen. The nearest one brandishes a knife pointed downward at about the level of his waist, “THEY GO LONG BOAT ‘SWIFT’... WE SWIM QUIET… MOSTLY UNDERWATER! WE CLIMB ABOARD BIG BOAT, CATCH BAD MAN!”
The men swim underwater with Kala toward the Swift, knives held in their teeth.
