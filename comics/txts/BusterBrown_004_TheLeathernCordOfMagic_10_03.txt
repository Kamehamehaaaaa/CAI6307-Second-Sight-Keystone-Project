The freed man faces his body toward Jafara, who sits on the ground and looks over his shoulder at the hulking giant that is the jinn. He shouts, “LOOK CLOSELY OH, ONCE MIGHTY JINN! THE CORD OF MAGIC IS NOW AROUND MY WAIST!... NOW I AM MASTER… I COMMAND YOU BY THE MAGIC OF THE LEATHERN THONG TO BE A MIGHTY STALLION TO CARRY US FROM BASSORAH TO BAGHDAD!”
A blue horse stands, main streaking out in all directions, inside a yellow flash. The scene around it is a purple monochrome. Narration says, “AND AT ONCE A STRANGE TRANSFORMATION TAKES PLACE…”
A midpage narration box says, “AND AS THE MIGHTY STEED CARRIED THEM SWIFTLY FROM BASSORAH TOWN TO BAGHDAD, KARIM TOLD JAFARAH HOW HE AND THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS MYRRAH WERE TO BE MARRIED, WHEN HER FATHER, THE GREAT CALIPH, OBJECTED! THE CALIPH’S WAZIR, BELE KAHR, A MAGICIAN, CONSPIRED WITH JINN TO PLACE A SPELL ON HIM, AND TURN HIM INTO AN EAGLE!”
Karim and Jafara ride Jinn, now a blue stallion, over a hill.Karim says, “BUT I HEARD THEM SAY THAT IF THE CORD WERE TIED AROUND MY WAIST, THEN I WOULD BE THE MASTER! AND NOW, WE GO TO MEET THE WICKED WAZIR, AND WIN MY PRINCESS!”
Karim, Jafara, and Jinn peek around a stone archway into a garden where a buff guard watches two women speaking. Jinn laments, “WE’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET PAST THE GUARDS!” Karim assuages his doubts, “I HAVE A PLAN! BUT FIRST, i HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE CHANGE FOR OUR JINN!”
