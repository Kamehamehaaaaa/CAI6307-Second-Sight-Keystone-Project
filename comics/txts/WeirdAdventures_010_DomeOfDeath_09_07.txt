A narration box begins, “‘SWEDE’ AND ANNA FIGHT TO FOLLOW JOE THROUGH THE STREETS FULL OF MADDENED PEOPLE. BUT FINALLY…” Anna and Swede stand amid a crowd of people. Anna points toward Joe and shouts, “SEE, LARS! THERE! HE’S GOING INTO THE HOTEL…” Swede replies, “WE’LL HAVE HIM, ANNA!” Joe dips into a building in the background.
Swede busts through a hotel room door. Joe shouts, “WHAT TH- ‘SWEDE’!” Swede shouts, “GIVE ME THAT RING!”
Joe says, “GET BACK ‘SWED’, DON’T COME ANY CLOSER!” and holds a pistol up pointed at Swede. He charges anyway, “I SAID… GIVE ME THAT RING!” Anna points to the gun, “LOOK OUT, LARS! THEY’LL SHOOT!”
From offscreen, the other man says, “YOU’RE DARN RIGHT WE’LL SHOOT!” and points his own gun at Swede. He and Joe shoot Swede at point-blank range but it doesn’t stop him, “IT - IT DON’T STOP HIM!” Swede says, from the other side of a table separating him from the other two men, “NOTHING… CAN STOP ME… NOW!” 
Jumping over the table, knocking it over, Swede bangs the two men’s heads together. Anna shouts, “LARS! Y-YOU’RE WOUNDED!” Swede urges her,  “THE RING, ANNA! TAKE THE RING!” Joe screams, “AAAGHHHHH!” as his skull is smashed against his accomplice’s.
Anna, ring in hand, stands by the destroyed door saying, “BUT YOU’RE BADLY HURT! I’LL CALL A DOCTOR!” Swede struggles to stand up behind the table, trying to place his weight on it to support him, and he groans “NO, ANNA! GO… TAKE THE RING… TURN OFF THE MACHINE! DO AS I SAY! IT’S MY LIFE… AGAINST THOUSANDS!”
