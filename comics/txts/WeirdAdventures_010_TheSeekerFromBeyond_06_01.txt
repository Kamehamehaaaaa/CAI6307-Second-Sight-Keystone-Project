Narration begins, “SHE POSSESSED UNEARTHLY BEAUTY. THIS AMAZING APPARITION FROM OUT OF THE NIGHT! AND JOHN GRANT WAS SOON TO LEARN THAT ALL OF THE TREASURES OF THE COSMOS, WHAT THE STRANGE BEAUTY DESIRED MOST WAS-- HIM! TERROR STALKS THE PREY OF… THE SEEKER FROM BEYOND”
John Grant wears a brown suit and blue tie, and he sits at a table outside a winery cafe with Jane. Just as he lifts his beverage, Jane places a hand on his arm. John asks Jane, “WHAT IS IT, JANE? WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?” Jane replies, “THAT GIRL- -! SHE HASN’T TAKEN HER EYES OFF YOU SINCE WE SAT DOWN, JOHN! THERE’S SOMETHING EERIE ABOUT HER!” Right of the seated couple, a blonde woman with a silver headdress stands over the table from the other side of a railing separating the cafe’s outdoor dining area from the sidewalk. She wears no shirt or blouse but, instead, a green cape over her back and green cloth over her legs. She wears a silver breastplate molded into the exact shape of a brazier and a silver belt and cufflinks that secure her fabrics.
John and Jane walk away on the sidewalk. Over her shoulder, out of the corner of her eye, Jane notices that the woman from the cafe is following them, “AND NOW SHE’S FOLLOWING US! DO YOU KNOW HER, JOHN? WHO IS SHE?” John answers, “I’VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE” The woman follows them past stout three and four story buildings as they walk.
Narration says, “SUDDENLY” John falls over with his leg catching on a small, metal fence which is put around an opened manhole during maintenance. He shouts, “OOOPS!” Jane cries, “LOOK OUT!” Behind them a red car is coming toward the viewer, and John has just fallen into its path.
