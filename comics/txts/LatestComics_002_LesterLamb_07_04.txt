The story kicks off with Mary walking alongside Lester, setting a firm tone as she declares, "LESTER, YOU MUST PROMISE TO BEHAVE FROM NOW ON!" as they pass a rumbling steamroller on the street. Chaos erupts in an instant when Lester strays too close, and Mary cries out in panic, "LESTER! … I DIDN’T MEAN…!" as the steamroller flattens him flat as a pancake.
Undeterred, Lester bounces back to shape with a cheeky grin, tearing a hole in his own wool and boasting, "NOT A BAD PRESSING JOB, EH?" Mary, exasperated and teary-eyed, sniffs and scolds, "I CAN’T BEAR TO LOOK! SNIFF! HE WAS SUCH A NICE LAMB! SNIFF! EVEN IF HE WAS A NUISANCE!" She adds with a sigh, "IT WAS POSITIVELY SHAMEFUL OF YOU TO SCARE ME LIKE THAT!" and laments, "I GUESS I’M A LAMB WHO’S IN A STEW!" The scene shifts as a dapper gentleman, Mr. Havcash, the banker, approaches, prompting Mary to exclaim, "OH! THERE’S DADDY’S BANKER, MR. HAVCASH!" Lester, ever the troublemaker, rolls his eyes and mutters, "OH OH… THAT GUY CAN TALK FOR HOURS!" as they continue their playful journey.
