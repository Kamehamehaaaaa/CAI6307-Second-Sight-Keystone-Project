The man in green suit opens the closet door and a man in blue suit who seems unconscious falls down the closet, and the man in green suit yells “LOOK NICK!” . The scene is continued after a few minutes with Nick, a man in a brown suit from earlier, saying “HIS BODY WAS STILL WARM —- WELL AL?” From the looks of it Al was trying to call the police or ambulance and he enters the front door and says “THE PHONES OUT OF ORDER. THERE’S ONE ACROSS THE STREET”
 Nick, Al and the young boy are seen rushing out of the house where they find police on the outside asking them “AHA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING IN SUCH A HURRY? NOT CALLING US?” To which Al replies that they were about to call the police.
 After several hours at the police headquarters Al asks the inspector named Dykes “CAN WE GO NOW INSPECTOR DYKES?” To which Dykes responds “STICK AROUND. THE STORY OF THE JANITOR CARL DOESN’T TALLY WITH YOURS”.
 The next day at the Argus office, Nick is seen talking to Al, who’s solving a jigsaw puzzle, in a tense tone “YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR A DOG! NOW WE ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING KILLED THE OLD RECLUSE. STOP PLAYING WITH JIGSAW PUZZLES AND GET US OUT OF THIS MESS!” To which Nick replies “THATS EXACTLY WHAT I AM DOING LOOK”.
 “SO WHAT? THE OLD GUY PROBABLY WAS AS MAD AS A HATTER!” Says Nick looking at the jigsaw puzzle, to which Al disagrees and says “I DON’T THINK SO. I BELIEVE HE REALLY OWNED ALL THAT CASH!”.
