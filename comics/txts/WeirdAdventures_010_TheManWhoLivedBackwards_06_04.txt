Narration introduces the scene where Paul stands holding Peggy close with David close to the viewer in the foreground, “EVEN AS I HAD EXPECTED, I REACHED THE MOMENT WHEN PEGGY AND I ANNOUNCED OUR ENGAGEMENT TO DAVID.” To himself, Paul thinks, “I SEE YOU LIPS MOVE, DAVID, AND I REMEMBER YOUR WARM WORDS OF CONGRATULATIONS! BUT NOW I KNOW YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE.” Correctly, David says, “WELL, THE BEST MAN WON! I’M GLAD IT’S YOU, PAUL… IF IT COULDN’T BE ME!”
Peggy and Paul exchange a passionate kiss. Peggy accepts his wedding proposal, “I LOVE YOU, PAUL! OF COURSE I’LL MARRY YOU! I’VE WAITED SO LONG FOR YOU TO ASK ME!” Paul says, mechanically, “DAVID MUST BE THE FIRST TO KNOW!” Meanwhile, he actually thinks, “HOW STRANGE TO RELIVE THE PAST!”
Another narration box says, “WITH GRIM INEVITABILITY, TIME RUSHED BACKWARD. I FOUND MYSELF IN DAVID’S COUNTRY HOUSE, IN HIS BASEMENT LABORATORY! HE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE STUDY OF BLACK MAGIC FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON.” Paul eyes David suspiciously from behind his back as he pours the contents of a thin test tube into a flask.
Shaking David’s hand and beginning to walk backward up a set of stairs, Paul reasons, “I RELIVE MY PAST… BUT I CAN’T DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE MY LIFE! IF ONLY I COULD!”
There is a panel of narration, “I HAVE LOST TRACK OF TIME! THE AGONY OF DESPAIR POUNDS AND TORTURES MY BRAIN! DAYS… WEEKS… MONTHS… MERGE INTO THE SWIFT BACKWASH OF MY LIFE! THERE’S NOT EVEN A GLIMMER OF HOPE!”
Thrashing his limbs about helplessly and contorting his face with fear and frustration, Paul sinks into a bullseye surrounded by yellow, orange, and red rings.
Narration marks a scene transition, saying “AND THEN AS THE DAYS SPED BACKWARD, I REACHED THE TIME WHEN DAVID AND I HAD CONE ON A HUNTING TRIP! AND I REMEMBERED OUR CONVERSATION AS WE MOVED BACKWARDS UP THE HILL!” The men are wearing plain shirts with square caps and hold rifles over their shoulders. Paul says, “WE’VE HAD ENOUGH OF HUNTING, DAVID! LET’S GO HOME!” David thanks Paul profusely, “YOU SAVED MY LIFE, PAUL! I’LL NEVER FORGET THAT!”
Paul, pictured in his blue suit again, realizes, “I SAVED HIS LIFE! IN A FEW MINUTES, I’M GOING TO RELIVE THAT EXPERIENCE! IF ONLY I COULD UNDO SOMETHING I DID IN THE PAST!”
