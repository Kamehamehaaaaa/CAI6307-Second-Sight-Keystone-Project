Two young boys, one with a blue hat called Willie and another with a red hat, are seen in the panel, with Willie knocking the hat of the other boy. 
“GET UP! I’M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU YET” says Willie to the red shirt boy. 
A man enters the panel and pointing towards Willie he says  “WHY WILLE YOU SHOULDN’T FIGHT LIKE THAT” 
Willie justifying his punch says “HE CALLED MY SISTER A LOT OF NAMES”.
The man who seems to know Willie says “BUT YOU HAVEN’T ANY SISTER”
To which Willie replies “I KNOW I HAVEN’T”.
He says “I WAS FIGHTIN’ FOR TH’ PRINCIPLE OF THE THING” by pointing towards himself.
