A narration box concludes the scene of Professor John’s murder. “LEAVING THE LIMP, DEAD THING THAT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR KINGSLEY BEHIND, THE AMOK ROBOT CHARGES INTO THE STORMY NIGHT…” Katha leans to fit through the window of the room in which she killed Professor John. Looking down on his body, she resolves, “JIM… DOESN’T WANT ME! BUT BARBARA WON’T HAVE HIM! I KILLED THE PROFESSOR! I CAN KILL JIM, TOO!”
“MEANWHILE,” Jim Drake holds Barbara in an embrace. She says, “THE GUESTS ARE ALL GONE. I SHOULD BE HAPPY THIS IS THE EVE OF OUR HONEYMOON… AND YET I’M AFRAID, JIM… TERRIBLY AFRAID… OF SOME UNKNOWN DANGER THAT THREATENS US BOTH!” Jim tries to calm Barbara, “YOU’RE JUST UPSET BECAUSE OF THE STRANGE ACTIONS OF THE PROFESSOR’S GIRL FRIEND FORGET IT, BARBARA!”
They sit on a couch near the fire, and Barbara sits with an arm around Jim Drake, and he places a hand on her lap. “NO, JIM! I CAN’T SHAKE OFF THE FEELING THAT SOMETHING AWFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN!” Jim Drake leans in and replies, changing the subject, “KISS ME, DEAR, AND DON’T GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT…”
From outside the room, Katha watches Jim Drake kiss his wife and burns, sweating, with jealousy, “THEY KISS… SHARING AN EMOTION I CAN NEVER KNOW! I’LL KILL THEM BOTH!”
A narration box explains Katha’s plan to break into Jim Drake’s house, “FURIOUSLY KATHA ATTACKS THE DOOR. HER FISTS BATTER AT IT AGAIN… AND AGAIN… AND AGAIN…” Katha pounds the door furiously with her clenched fists saying, “IT’S SMASHING… I’LL HAVE IT BROKEN DOWN SOON!”
Barbara starts, saying “JIM! SOMEONE IS SMASHING IN THE DOOR! WHO - WHAT - CAN IT BE?!” Jim Drake says, “I’LL GO SEE!”
