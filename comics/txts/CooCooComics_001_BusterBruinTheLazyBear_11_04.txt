Buster Bruin runs out of his front door to find the source of the chopping noise.
Buster Bruin leans over to speak to a group of three beavers beside a tree. One of them is holding an axe and appears to be in the middle of cutting down the tree. Buster Bruin asks, “HEY! WHAT’S GOIN’ ON HERE?”
The beaver with the axe sits and explains, “WE GOTTA CHOP DOWN THIS TREE- - - WE’RE BUILDING A DAM!” Buster Bruin makes his request, “WELL, BE A LITTLE MORE QUIET ABOUT IT!”
Walking away, Buster Bruin smiles and says to himself, “THAT’S TELLIN’ EM - - NOW MEBBE I CAN GET SOME SLEEP!” Behind his back, the beaver with the axe continues to chop at the tree.
Back in his bed, Buster Bruin covers up again and says “THASS BETTER- -”
Outside, the beaver who cut the tree down brings its hands to its face and yells, “TIMBER!” On the bottom of the panel, another beaver flees the path of the tree as it starts to fall.
