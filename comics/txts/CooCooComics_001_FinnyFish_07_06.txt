Finny says, "NOW THAT WE’RE WID OF THE DWAGON, LET’S START LOOKING FOR THE TWEASURE! While Spike is seen thinking, “TREASURE? WHAT TREASU—OH DAT TREASURE! HMM… HE STILL TINKS DAT I’M ON THE LEVEL! DIS GIVES ME AN IDEA!" as others listen in the background.
Spike is seen plotting, "I’LL HIDE A BAG OF MARBLES WHERE I CAN FIND DEM IN A HURRY—AND PRETEND IT’S DE TREASURE!" 
Spike then proposes, "ER… BEFORE WE START SEARCHIN’—LET’S MAKE A GEN’LEMAN’S BET—SAY TWO BITS DAT I FIND DE TREASURE FOIST!" with Finny agreeing, "UH-WELL… AWIGHT!" 
Spike’s confidence is captured with, "OH BOY! I CAN’T LOSE! I’LL LET ‘EM HUNT AROUND A WHILE—SO IT WON’T LOOK PHONEY—DEN I’LL DIG UP DE TWO-BITS!" 
Finny, discouraged exclaims, "GEE! I’M DISCOURAGED! WE’VE LOOKED FOR HOURS! LET’S GO BACK AND SEE HOW HE’S MADE OUT!" and Gertie exclaiming, “IF YOU ASK ME I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY TREASURE AT ALL!” Looking tired, wiping seat off her forehead.
Spike rests saying, "HA, HA, HERE COME FINNY AND GERTIE, EMPTY-HANDED! YOU KEEP ‘EM BUSY HERE AND DEN COME OUT AND TELL ‘EM I’VE FOUND DE TREASURE!" with Johnny replyies, "O.K.—SPIKE!" 
Spike teasingly says, "TOO BAD YA DIDN’T HAVE NO LUCK… SPIKE’S BACK IN DE CAVE—SOICHIN’!" And Finny is seen pondering, "HMM! THIS CERTAINLY IS A PECULIAR CAVE—I WONDER—?" as teeth glint in the background.
