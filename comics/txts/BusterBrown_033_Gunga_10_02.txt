The scene begins with  a narration, “MEANWHILE, RAMA PREPARES TO GIVE ANOTHER LESSON TO BABY ‘TUSKER’, THE PET OF EVERYONE IN THE MAHARAJA’S PALACE.”
Rama, clad in a green turban and loincloth, stands beside a young elephant named Tusker, adorned with a red harness. Rama instructs, "SO, TUSKER. IT IS BETTER THAT YOU ARE QUIET. PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE WHICH EVERY ELEPHANT MUST LEARN," his calm demeanor contrasting with Tusker’s attentive pose. 
Gunna who is seen with Teela, asks Rama, “ANOTHER LESSON FOR TUSKER? IS HE LEARNING WELL, RAMA?” Rama replies in praises, "HE PULLS THE LITTLE BULLOCK CART AS WELL AS HIS FATHER PULLS THE BIG WAGON IN OUR DASARA PARADE. COME, HE WILL TAKE US FOR A RIDE." The boy raises his hand eagerly, and Rama nods, suggesting a shared adventure. 
Rama is seen observing Tusker pulling a cart, exclaiming, "AIE! HE PULLS THE CART WELL. HE LEARNS RAPIDLY, AND THAT REMINDS ME. HAVE YOU SEEN BABU?" His surprised expression and the cart’s movement lines highlight Tusker’s progress, while the question hints at concern for another elephant, Babu. Rama recounting, replies, "ONLY THIS MORNING, HE WAS TRAINING THE COW ELEPHANT, PADMAH. SHE WAS ACTING VERY BADLY. HE USED THE BULL HOOK SEVERAL TIMES," to Gunna, who listens intently.
Gunna and Rama are seen deciding, "LET TUSKER TAKE US TO BABU. PERHAPS WE CAN HELP HIM," as they point toward the distance. Tusker stands ready. 
The next scene depicts Babu struggling with Padmah, a large cow elephant, as text notes, "AND IN TRUTH, BABU WAS HAVING HIS TROUBLES WITH PADMAH, THE BIG COW ELEPHANT. THIS DAY SHE WAS EVEN MORE UNRULY THAN USUAL." Babu shouts, “DOWN, PADMAH! DOWN!" his raised arm and the elephant’s raised trunk conveying the chaos.
