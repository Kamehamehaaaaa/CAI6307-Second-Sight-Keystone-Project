Mary, dressed in her red outfit, leading her fluffy companion Lester toward a brick building with a sign that reads "Children’s Haircuts Our Specialty." Mary announces, "THE FIRST THING I HAVE TO DO IS GET A HAIRCUT!" as they step inside the cozy parlor. Inside, a stylist greets them, and Mary instructs, "NOW LESTER, SIT OVER THERE AND READ A MAGAZINE!" to which Lester cheerfully replies, "OKAY!" He plops down in a chair, flipping through the pages of a magazine, but soon grows restless, grumbling, "BAH! I’VE ALREADY READ THESE OLD MAGAZINES!" His curiosity piques as he wonders, "I WONDER WHAT IS IN THERE!" and sneaks a peek behind a curtain, his shadow cast on the wall, hinting at mischief brewing.
Lester’s boredom turns into excitement when he spots a device that catches his eye. With a mischievous glint, he exclaims, "HMM… A PERMANENT WAVE MACHINE! IT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME!" as he reaches for the machine, clearly plotting to give himself a stylish makeover. The scene ends with Lester’s playful antics on full display, leaving us eager to see how his beauty parlor adventure unfolds!
