BUSTER BRUIN THE LAZY BEAR. The titular Buster Bruin wears an orange nightcap and sleeps beneath a yellow sheet in a bed fashioned from logs. To the extreme right of the panel, two cubs, one grey and the other brown, sleep together in a wooden cot made from planks. On a table in the foreground, an alarm clock labeled with the seasons SPRING, FALL, SUMMER, and WINTER sits in the foreground and indicates that Spring has come. The clock sits on the table with medicines.
Buster Bruin stretches in bed yawning, “HO-HUM! IT’S ABOUT TIME i STARTED HIBERNATING FOR THE WINTER!”
He holds the season-labeled clock in one paw saying, “I’LL SET IT FOR SPRING!” The one arm of the clock is already pointing to SPRING.
