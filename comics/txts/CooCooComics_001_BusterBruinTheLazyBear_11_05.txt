A loud “CRASH!” shakes Buster Bruin’s house so violently that it throws Buster Bruin upward out of bed. He screams, startled, “YEE-OWW!”
Running from his bed, we see a thin cloth catching around Buster Bruin’s neck
The cloth is stretched taut around his snout and vibrates under tension, holding Buster Bruin back although his legs still turn beneath him. He begins to ask, “W-WHAT THE- - -”
The cloth pulls him backward, off of his feet, back toward the bed.
Buster Bruin is thrown backward to the wall behind his bed with a “CRASH!” He hits it just beneath a hanging embroidery that says “HOME SWEET HOME”.
The embroidery falls on Buster Bruin, and his head smashes through it. Seeing stars, Buster Bruin questions, “W-WHAT H-HAPPENED?”
