Karim and Jafara face away from the camera, and Karim commands Jinn, “OH JINN… I COMMAND YOU TO BECOME A TINY MOUSE!”
An orange narration box says,”OVER THE WALL AND INTO THE SHRUBBERY GO JAFARA AND KARIM, TO ATTRACT MYRRAH’S ATTENTION AS SHE PASSES ON THE WALK…” Karim stands behind Jafara in bushes next to a tall tree. Peering over the boy, he speaks to Myrrah, “SSST! MY PRINCESS! MY BELOVED MYRRAH! QUICKLY, STAND ASIDE WHILE I FRIGHTEN AWAY YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS!” Myrrah, wearing an orange dress with black markings, a black top, and an ornate orange and yellow headdress, hears Karim and turns to acknowledge him while two blonde women speak near her.
Karim, Myrrah, and Jafara walk rightward. Jafara turns his head to face the other two as they walk and says, “A WOMAN WILL FACE A LION… BUT NEVER A MOUSE!” Karim replies, “A WISE SAYING FOR A LITTLE BOY, BUT COM NOW, MYRRAH MUST TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS UNDER THE SPELL…” In the background a woman with blue hair stands atop a brown platform, pulling up her dress to her lower thigh and looking down, shocked, where Jinn, in the form a black mouse, crawls up the platform in her direction. Further afield, two women run into a domed building.
Karim and Myrrah sit on a stone bench, and Jafara stands in the foreground. The princess explains, “MY FATHER IS VERY ILL! NO PHYSICIAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO CURE HIM.. HE IS ATTENDED ONLY BY HIS WAZIR, BELE KAHR!” Karim puts his arm around her shoulders, consoling her, “BELE KAHR IS CRUEL, WICKED, AND JEALOUS OF YOUR FATHER’S WEALTH AND POWER! TONIGHT, MYRRAH, GUIDE US SECRETLY TO YOUR FATHER’S CHAMBERS.. WE MAY SEE SOMETHING OF INTEREST!”
