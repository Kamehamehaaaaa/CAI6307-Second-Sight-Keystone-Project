Zada now stands beside the bench, saying “WE SHALL LEAVE TONIGHT!” John turns to her surprised, questioning “TONIGHT?” Jane hunches over on the seat of the bench.
Jane comes to and asks, “WHAT.. WHAT.. HAPPENED?” John lies, “JUST A MUGGER, HONEY! I DROVE HIM OFF! NOW I’D BETTER GET YOU HOME!”
Narration between panels indicates a transition, “LATE THAT NIGHT, FILLED WITH DREAD FOREBODING, JOHN WAITED…” Zada appears in John’s home again. She greets him, “I HAVE COME TO KEEP THE BARGAIN. TOGETHER WE SHALL RULE XEDES.. AND YOU SHALL RULE MY HEART! YOU SHALL LOVE ME.. NOT LIKE THE OTHER ONE WHO ONLY WANTED POWER! John surrenders, “WELL.. THERE’S NOTHING TO BE DONE, I SUPPOSE, I’LL GO WITH YOU” But in his mind, he thinks, “BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING.. SOME WAY.. WAIT! I HAVE AN IDEA!”
Jone lifts a palm to gesture at Zada, saying “I’LL GO ALL RIGHT, ZADA! BUT I SHALL DO MORE THAN RULE YOUR HEART! I SHALL BE THE ONE WHO IS MASTER OF XEDES.. WHILE YOU WILL BE MY THRALL.. MY SLAVE!” Zada rejects him immediately, agast, “NO - -NO! I AM THE QUEEN! I HAVE THE POWER…”
John continues his bluff, almost smiling as he continues, “YOU’RE WRONG! YOU ARE WEAK- - A WOMAN! ONLY I HAVE THE STRENGTH TO RULE! I DON’T LOVE YOU… I LOVE POWER!” Zada turns away from him and says, “I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN! YOU’RE AS BAD AS MANDOR WAS.. CRAVING ONLY POWER! NO.. YOU ARE NOT THE ONE I SEEK! ONCE MORE I HAVE MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENT! FAREWELL!”
John screws his eyes shut and clasps his hands tightly together as though he were praying. Silently, he is elated, “IT WORKED! SHE’S LEAVING! I’VE WON!” THE END.
