The narration ends and the old man looks at the aircraft from the lake and says to Paul “WELL, THE DAMAGE WASN’T AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT, PAUL! WE’LL BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD WITH THE TESTS!”. Paul replies pointing towards the sky “WONDERFUL POP! BUT LOOK UP THERE!”.
A large plane is seen flying high in the sky and Paul says “THAT’S THE CONVAIR BUILT NAVY R3Y-1 TURBOPROP TRANSPORT!” 
The old man describes R3Y-1 saying “THE POTENTIALS OF THE R3Y-1 WERE FIRST REALIZED BY UTILIZING A 9 FOOT RADIO-CONTROLLED, DYNAMICALLY-SIMILAR POWERED MODEL!” 
Few months later the testing of the flight by the old man and Paul seems complete and the old man says to Rich, the man who would fly the prototype of the model, says “GOOD LUCK, RICH! WE’VE DONE EVERYTHING HU,ANLY POSSIBLE TO ASSURE A SAFE FLIGHT!”. Rich replies back “THANKS, POP! KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED!”
The next panel shows a water based aircraft taking off and someone from the pier yells “THERE HE GOES!”. 
The narration describes that on April 9 1953 the CONVAIR YF2Y-1 Sea Dart fastest water based aircraft in the world made its maiden flight from San Diego Bay California.
