Babu commands, "HE HAS THE ROPE ON PADMAH, HOLD TIGHTLY, RAMA!" as Rama responds, "WITH ALL MY STRENGTH." The two mahouts pull a thick rope attached to Padmah, their strained expressions and the rope’s tension highlighting the struggle.
The scene shifts to Gunga running swiftly, as the narration notes, "THE HERD OF ELEPHANTS, NEARSIGHTED AND HARD OF HEARING, TRY TO LOCATE THE DANGER THEY SENSE NEAR. BUT SWIFT RUNNING GUNGA IS TOO FAST." His agile leap through the grass, with motion lines trailing behind, adding a sense of urgency.
Gunga exclaims, "HOLD HARD! WE HAVE HER CAPTURED!" while Rama praises, "GOOD WORK, GUNGA!" The mahouts pull the rope together, their teamwork evident as Padmah struggles in the background.
The narration, "PANIC-STRICKEN AT THE UNKNOWN FEAR, THE WILD HERD STAMPEDES! PADMAH TRIES TO FOLLOW…" depicts chaos. The herd’s massive forms charge through the grass, their trunks raised, while Padmah’s silhouette shows her attempt to join them. 
Padmah’s defeat is reflected by the narration, "…BUT HER STRUGGLES ARE USELESS. THE HEAVY KEDDAH ROPE HOLDS PADMAH FAST." Her large form stands subdued, the rope tightly secured around her leg, her trunk lowered in resignation. 
Gunga declares, "WE HAVE CAPTURED HER. WE WILL SNIB IN THE REOPE AS YOU SEND HER BACK.” Babu replies, “SHE WILL RECEIVE HER LESSON, GUNGA. NEVER FEAR. KEEP THE ROPE TIGHT.” The mahouts hold the rope firmly, their confident stances reflecting victory.
