Mary, with her blonde curls and red bow, firmly scolds her fluffy companion, "LESTER LAMB! THAT’S ONE OF YOUR TRICKS, AND IF YOU DO ONE MORE TRICK LIKE THAT, I’M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU WITH ME ANYMORE!" Lester, looking sheepish but unrepentant, responds with a playful bleat, "I’M JUST A BAA-A-D BOY?" his tone hinting at a mischievous charm.
Determined to move forward, Mary shifts her focus, declaring, "I HAVE TO TRY ON MY NEW RED COAT FOR SIZE NEXT!" as she steps into a cozy shop, Lester trailing closely behind. A cheerful shopkeeper greets her warmly, saying, "OH YES, STEP RIGHT THIS WAY, MISS!" Inside, Lester’s curiosity gets the better of him as he inspects the rack of coats, quipping, "WELL, IF IT ISN’T MY OLD FRIEND! I ALWAYS KNEW I’D WIND UP THIS WAY!" Meanwhile, Mary, intrigued by a coat, muses, "THIS IS A QUAINT NUMBER… I THINK I’LL TRY IT ON!" unaware that the "coat" she’s eyeing is actually Lester blending in with the rack.
The scene takes a hilarious turn as the shopkeeper, holding up what she believes is a coat, proudly announces, "I KNOW YOU’LL LIKE THIS NUMBER. IT’S THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE LEFT! IT’S REDUCED TO NINETY-EIGHT DOLLARS!" But as Mary and the shopkeeper turn to admire the selection, they’re met with a shocking surprise—Lester, tangled up among the coats, reveals himself with a mischievous grin. Both Mary and the shopkeeper let out a startled "EEK!” as the fluffy lamb’s antics leave them in a state of bewildered amusement, bringing the shopping trip to a chaotic close.
