Paul holds Davide from falling off a sheer cliff under a narration box. The box says, “DAVID HAD TIPPED AND FALLEN OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF… HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF A BUSH AND I HAD RUN TO HIS RESCUE! BUT AS I RELIEVED THE SCENE BACKWARDS IF FOUND MYSELF LOWERING HIM, HOLDING ON TO THE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT COLLAR. I REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID AT THAT MOMENT…” Holding David by his shirt in his grasp, Paul calls down to David, “HOLD TIGHT, DAVID! A LITTLE MORE AND I’LL PULL YOU UP!” Paul lies on the cliff as David struggles over the edge, saying “IT’S SLIPPING DAVID! QUICK! QUICK1 SAVE ME!
Holding David up over the cliff by the collar, Paul laments, sweating, “WHAT A FOOL I WAS OR AM NOW, DAVID! TO SAVE YOUR LIFE AT THE RISK OF MY OWN… ONLY TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO DESTROY ME LATER!”
A narration box says, “NOW I WAS RUNNING BACKWARDS FROM THE CLIFF TO OUR CAMP…” Paul’s silhouette moves backward across the scene as he thinks, “DAVID!”
A narration panel says, “THE BACKWARD FLOW OF MY LIFE BROUGHT ME TO THE MOMENT WHEN I WAS SETTING UP OUR CAMP… AND HAD LOOKED AROUND FOR DAVID! THERE HAD BEEN NO REASON FOR ME TO WORRY ABOUT… BUT SOME SIXTH SENSE TOLD ME HE WAS IN DANGER!” Setting up camp in reverse, Paul wonders aloud, “WHERE DID HE WANDER OFF TO? EVERYTIME THERE’S WORK TO BE DONE… MAYBE I OUGHT TO LOOK FOR HIM?” But Paul thinks, “HAD I NOT CONE LOOKING FOR HIM AT THIS MOMENT… BUT I MUST I CANNOT CHANGE WHAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED OR… CAN I?
Paul sweats harshly and puts on a stern expression. He thinks, “BUT WHAT CAN I DO? WAIT TILL TOMORROW? THAT WILL NEVER COME! WAIT TILL YESTERDAY? YES, THAT’S IT! I’LL WAIT TILL THE PRECEDING HOUR!” But Paul thinks again, “BUT THAT WOULD BE COLD-BLOODED MURDER! NO, I CAN’T DO IT! I MUST SAVE HIM! I MUST!”
A narration box says, “MY BRAIN WHIRLED! MY LUNGS ACHED AS IF THEY WOULD BURST! AND THEN I WAS RUNNING… RUNNING LIKE A MANIAC. WHAT WAS HAPPENING? WAS THIS MAD NIGHTMARE REVERSING ITSELF? THEN I FOUND MYSELF AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF…” Below it, david sweats nervously as he peers over his shoulder at the unseen ground below. He tells Paul, “THE COLLAR WON’T HOLD! IT’S RIPPING AWAY!” He pleads for his life as his cap falls off, “PAUL! I’M GOING! SAVE ME!”
David falls unseen below, shouting “AAAAGH!” Paul lays on the cliff and looks down as David falls, a ripped piece of David’s collar in one hand, and he thinks, “TOO LATE! TOO LATE!! DAVID!”
