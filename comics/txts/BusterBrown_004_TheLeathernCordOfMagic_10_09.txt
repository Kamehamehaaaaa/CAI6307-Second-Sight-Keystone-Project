Left-to-right, Jafara, Myrrah and Karim stand facing the Caliph, and Bele Kahr confronts them, drawing his sword. Myrrah remarks, “LOOK.. MY FATHER IS RISING AND THE WAZIR DRAWS HIS BLADE…” Karim reaches for his scabbard, affixed to his belt, and says, “I HAVE A BLADE TO DRAW ALSO, MY BELOVED! STADE ASIDE!”
Knees bent and blades in their right hands, Karim and Bele Kahr look each other in the eye. “CROSS YOUR BLADE WITH MINE, CRUEL SORCERER, FOR TODAY YOU HAVE WORKED YOUR LAST SPELL!”, shouts Karim. Bele Kahr replies, “FOOL THAT YOU ARE. I HAVE GREAT MAGIC BEHIND ME! I CALL ON THE JINN, I CALL ON THE SPIRITS.. I CALL ON THE POWERS OF ALL THOSE ABIDE IN THE WORLD OF SHADE!”
A small panel of narration explains, “AND THE EVIL FORCES CAME AT THE CALL OF BELE KAHR, AND LENT THEIR POWER TO HIM…”
Myrrah, with an expression of worry, remarks, “JAFARA… KARIM IS WEAKENING BADLY!! HE IS LOST!!” Jafarah sees something she doesn’t, “NO! NO HE ISN’T SEE… THE LEATHERN CORD IS SLIPPING FROM HIS WAIST..” The faces of lavender demons peer, sneering from a cloud of white smoke that surrounds Bele Kahr, and he stands among them with arms outstretched toward Karim. Karim hunches over, trying to grip the leathern thong about his waist, warning “STAY BACK JAFARA… I AM LOST!”
