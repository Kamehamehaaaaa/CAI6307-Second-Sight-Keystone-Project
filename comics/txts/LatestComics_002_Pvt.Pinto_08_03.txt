In a cheerful wartime comic, Pvt. Pinto proudly shares a photo with his fellow soldiers, holding it up as they crowd around him, their faces lighting up with excitement. He boasts, "NOT BAD, EH SARGE? IT’S A PICTURE OF MY GIRL, LULU!" while the others, all in army uniforms, lean in to admire the image, their expressions full of enthusiasm. The sergeant, standing behind Pvt. Pinto, closely examines the photo, which is labeled "TO MY PAL JOEY," and murmurs, "HMMMM!" with a thoughtful, intrigued look, hinting at some hidden interest as he studies the picture of Lulu in her red dress.
The sergeant then teases Pvt. Pinto, saying, "Y’SHOW GOOD TASTE, PRIVATE, ER, DON’T YA THINK SHE OUGHT T’ MEET YER SARGE SOMETIME?" while playfully nudging him in the side, causing Pvt. Pinto to jump with surprise, stars bursting around his head from the unexpected jab. Pvt. Pinto, still reeling but excited, agrees enthusiastically, "SURE! SHE’S COMING TO VISIT ME SUNDAY! I’LL POINT ‘ER OUT TO ‘ER!" while the sergeant casually replies, "O.K.!" his hands in his pockets, already scheming as they stand amidst the army camp with tents in the background.
The sergeant’s imagination takes over as he daydreams with a sly grin, thinking, "IF I COULD JUST MEET THAT PIN-UP PLATTER, SHE’LL FORGET THERE EVER WAS A PINTO!" his hand on his chin as he envisions winning Lulu over, his expression brimming with confidence. The scene shifts to "VISITING DAY," marked by a sign on a tent, where Pvt. Pinto bursts out with a wide smile, shouting "LULU!!!" as he spots Lulu, the woman from the first page, arriving in her red dress and hat, holding a small purse. She waves back with a smile, while Pvt. Pinto rushes toward her, his arms outstretched in excitement, the camp bustling with activity around them. The comic captures the soldiers’ camaraderie and lighthearted romantic rivalry with a playful tone.
