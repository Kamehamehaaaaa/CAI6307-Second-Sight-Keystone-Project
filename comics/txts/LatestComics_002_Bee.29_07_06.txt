In a dramatic, wartime comic scene, the germ-carrying enemy flies, trapped in honey and rolled into a river by the bees, sink beneath the water’s surface, one of the fly cries desperately "FOOLS! FOOLS! FOOLS!" echoing as they drown, accompanied by a "GLUB! GLUB!" sound effect that emphasizes their demise. Two bees, including Bee 29 in a blue cape, watch from the riverbank, but one suddenly exclaims, "WHAT TH…! ONE OF ‘EM GOT AWAY!" while the other identifies the escapee, shouting, "IT’S THEIR CHIEF!" as the chief fly, a menacing black insect, buzzes off into the sky.
Bee 29, marked with the number 29 on its chest, takes charge with determination, declaring, "I’VE GOT TO STOP HIM! HE’S A MENACE TO PUBLIC HEALTH!" and zooms off in pursuit through a cloudy sky, leaving a trail behind. The chief fly, now ahead, taunts Bee 29 with a sinister grin, saying, "IF YOU STING ME YOU GET MORTAL GERM AND DIE!" to which Bee 29, caught off guard, responds, "GOSH! THAT IS RIGHT! WHAT’LL I DO?" its expression is a mix of worry and resolve. As they fly, Bee 29 realizes with alarm, "OH-OH! HE’S HEADING FOR FARMER GRAY’S!" spotting the farm in the distance with its red-roofed house and trees.
The chief fly, now nearing the farm, approaches Farmer Gray, who sits at a table with his head resting on his hand, looking weary. The fly, with a wicked chuckle, says, "HEE, HEE, NOW I MAKE WITH THE KISS OF DEATH," its intent clear as it hovers closer. The chief fly prepares to strike, declaring, "THIS IS GONNA HURT, FARMER GRAY, BUT IT’S GOTTA BE DONE!" as it aims to sting the unsuspecting farmer, spreading its deadly germs. The comic builds tension with this cliffhanger, blending wartime stakes with anthropomorphic drama as Bee 29 races to intervene.
