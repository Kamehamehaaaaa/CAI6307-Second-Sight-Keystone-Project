Myrrah leans over a steaming black pot on a brown stove and stirs whatever is in it. She says, “THERE! THE FISH ARE COOKED! NOW I MUST FIND US CLOTHING SO THAT WE WILL BE DISGUISED AS PALACE SERVANTS! THUS WE CAN EASILY GO INTO MY FATHER’S ROOM!” Karim stands watching behind her, and Jafara watches her on a stool.
Disguised, Karim, Jafara and Myrrah walk left-to-right. Karim holds a bowl of the steaming food and warns Jafara, “KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN, JAFARA! WE MUST BE READY FOR ANYTHING!” Jafarah walks with a long stride beside Karim and replies, “THE SMELL OF THOSE FISH MAKES ME HUNGRY!” Myrrah urges them from the other side of a potted plant in the foreground, “HURRY! MY FATHER’S CHAMBERS ARE JUST AHEAD!”
In a circular panel, Myrrah sticks her hand into a brown pot and Karim holds the white-bearded Caliph up in his bed by putting an arm around his shoulder. A narration scroll says, “AND SO, THE STRANGE MEAL PROGRESSED AND AS SOON AS THE LAST MORSEL PASSED THE LIPS OF THE CALIPH…” Jafara watches from the right side of the panel.
Myrrah and Karim stand in the foreground, witnessing the Caliph rise out of bed with concern evident on their faces. The Caliph simply says, “AH! THAT WAS A GOOD NIGHT’S SLEEP! NOW I MUST BE UP AND ABOUT!”
