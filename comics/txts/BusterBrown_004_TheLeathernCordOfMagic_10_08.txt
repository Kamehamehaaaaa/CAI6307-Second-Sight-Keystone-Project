Sitting straight up in his bed, the Caliph addresses Karim with shock, “YOU?! HOW DID YOU ESCAPE THE ENCHANTMENT, AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?” Karim says, “ONLY WITH THE HELP OF ALLAH, TO SAVE YOU FROM BELE KAHR, YOUR SORCERER! ONLY NOW HAVE WE LIFTED THE SPELL…”
The Caliph hunches over in shadow in the foreground. Myrrah stands between her father and Karim, and she pleads Karim’s case, “IT IS TRUE, FATHER! I COOKED THE FISH AND FED THEM TO YOU MYSELF! I SAW THE SPELL LIFT!”
Standing with Myrrah on the right side of the frame, Karim requests the Caliph, “PLEASE, SIRE. WE ASK ONLY THAT YOU RECLINE ONCE MORE UPON YOUR COUCH AND FEIGN UNCONSCIOUSNESS! THEN WATCH WHAT YOU WAZIR DOES!” Still hunched over and in shadow, the Caliph replies, “IT IS HARD FOR ME BELIEVE THIS, BUT I WILL DO AS YOU SAY…”
Karim and Myrrah return to the drapes from which they first watched Bele Kahr, and Karim says, “DO NOT FEAR, SIRE.. WE WILL BE NEAR…”
Bele Kahr returns to the Caliph’s bed, where he lies prone. The silhouette of Karim watches from beneath the drapes behind them. Watching over the Caliph, Bele Kahr says, “AH.. THE MIGHTY ONE IS STILL HELD BY THE SPELL! ONE MORE POTION, AND THERE WILL BE A NEW CALIPH IN BAGHDAD TOMORROW, AND IT WILL BE MYSELF!”
