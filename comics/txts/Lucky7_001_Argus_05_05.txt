Both Carl and Nick are engaged in a fight and Carl has a knife in his hand and attacks Nick with it. Nick says to Carl “NOT SO FAST CARL. I’M NOT AN OLD MAN!”
 Carl then hits Nick with a chair on his head “CRACK” and Nick is unconscious.
 Carl picks his knife up from the floor and the back books and says “WOULDN’T HE LIKE TO GET THESE — INSTEAD HE’S GONNA GET THIS!”
 As Carl tries to stab Nick, Inspector Dykes enters the room with a gun in his hands and says “DROP THAT KNIFE, CARL!”. Carl proceeds to attack the inspector with the knife and is shot down by the Inspector.
 With the killer Carl behind the bars Inspector Dykes calls Argus Inc, and credits Nick for his contribution on the case and summarizes by saying “THE OLD MAN OWNED THE HOUSE AND IT WAS CARL WHO BROUGHT HIM FOOD. HE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE MONEY AND KILLED THE RECLUSE, WHEN YOU INTERRUPTED HIM LOOKING FOR PAL, HE JUST HAD TIME ENOUGH TO STUFF THE BODY INTO THE CLOSET. THANKS TO YOU, NICK WE GOT THE MURDERER. I HOPE YOUR HEADS BETTER WHEN YOUR NEXT PROBLEM COMES UP!”
