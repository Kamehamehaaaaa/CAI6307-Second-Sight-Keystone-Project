The horse riding man from before approaches the Dopes’ cottage just as the Queen falls from the sky. She exclaims, “UM- A MAN!” as she falls toward the ground with a “WOOSH”.
She falls onto his horse’s shoulders, startling the man and his steed, saying “HELLO!” He simply says, “HUH!”
A narration box tells what happens next, “QUICKLY, THE QUEEN CASTS A MAGIC SPELL AT PRINCE CHARMING!” Prince Charming's eyes turn red and he wears a dumb smile saying, “W-WHY, YOU’RE BE-YOOT-IFUL! ARE YOU THE PRINCESS WOT ADVERTOSE?” The Queen smirks pointing her fingers toward Prince Charming as their eyes are connected by lightning bolts and she casts her spell on him.
Prince Charming is overjoyed and shouts, “GAWSH! LET’S ELOPE!”, as hugs the Queen tightly around her shoulders. The Queen laughs, “TEE-HEE!” His horse is exasperated, “MIGAWD, WOTTA BEAST!”
Narration in a far-left panel points to a center panel saying, “AND BACK AT THE HOUSE OF THE DOPES!”
In the panel in question, S’no Use stands over an unseen dish from which white and grey clouds of steam and smoke rise saying, “DINNER IS READY!” From out of view, the Dopes’ voices call, “OH NO! NOT THAT!”
Outside, we see the Dopes vacating the premises. Some of them kick up dust with the speed that they run from their house. Others amble away discreetly. All of them look at the open front door, and many of them sweat nervously. From within, S’no Use’s voice reaches them “YOO-HOO! WHERE IS EVERYBODY?”
