A narration reads, “THE NEXT MORNING EARLY THEY RISE REFRESHED FROM IMPROVISED BEDS IN THE BANANA GROVE, AND GUNGA OUTLINES HIS PLAN.”
Rama concerned says, "GUNGA YOU MUST NOT TRY A LONE KEDDAH. YOU CAN’T DRAG A ROPE UNDER THE BELLIES OF A WILD HERD TO CAPTURE ONE ELEPHANT." Babu, supporting Rama’s concern, adds, “THIS IS TRUE, GUNGA. HIRALAL WAS TRAMPLED TO DEATH LAST YEAR WHEN HE TRIED A LONE KEDDAH.”The text sets the scene after a restful night with Tusker in the background.
The group is seen, observing from a distance, "THE HERD WAS IN THE RIVER WHEN I SAW THEM. THEY MUST BE NEARBY FOR THE GRAZING IS GOOD HERE," to which the other replies, “WE MUST NOT TALK ANY MORE. I THINK I HEAR THEM” as they peer through the trees. 
Rama hushes Tusker, "TUSKER! QUIET!" while Gunga counters, "NO, RAMA, LET HIM CALL. THIS WAY WE CAN COME CLOSER TO THE HERD. THEY WILL THINK TUSKER IS ONE OF THEM." The jungle’s dense foliage frames the scene.
Gunga discovers, "THERE! THERE STANDS PADMAH…BUT SEE, THERE ARE MANY ELEPHANTS BETWEEN US," as Rama suggests, "COME. WE MUST FIND A KULU BUSH SO THAT I CAN HIDE MY SCENT."
Babu warns Gunga, "I STILL SAY YOU MAKE A MISTAKE IN TRYING A LONE KEDDAH, GUNGA," the scene concludes with Gunga’s confidence, "I THINK NOT. THE WAY THE HERD IS STANDING NOW, I AM SURE I CAN GET THE ROPE ON PADMAH’S LEG. THEN WE HAVE HER," The group’s focused gestures heighten the suspense.
