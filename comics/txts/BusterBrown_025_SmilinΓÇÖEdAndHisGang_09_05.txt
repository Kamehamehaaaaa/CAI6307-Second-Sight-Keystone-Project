The story begins with Smilin' Ed and his gang—Froggy the Gremlin, Midnight the Cat, Squeaky the Mouse, and the man in the blue climbing outfit—caught in a precarious situation after their encounter with the eagle and mountain goat. The group is sliding down the icy slope, roped together, with Midnight, Squeaky, and Froggy tumbling headfirst, their limbs flailing as they shout, "HEY! VERE ARE YOU GOIN’?" Smilin' Ed, the stout leader in his red and black climbing outfit with a green hat, clings to the mountain with his ice pick, looking bewildered. Nearby, a mountain goat with curved horns watches the chaos, its expression almost amused as it stands on a ledge. The sudden turn of events sets the stage for a dramatic rescue.
Just as it seems the group might plummet further, the mountain goat springs into action, using its horns to catch the falling rope, saving Smilin' Ed and the others from a steep drop. Smilin' Ed, now dangling safely, calls out with relief, "HELP! SOMEBODY SAVE ME!" Meanwhile, the man in the blue outfit, now in a gray climbing ensemble with a red hat, dangles below, shouting to the others higher up, "SMILIN’ ED—WAIT FOR ME! I’M SUPPOSED TO GO FIRST!" The silhouette of the group can be seen against the jagged peak, emphasizing their precarious position.
As the rescue unfolds, Smilin' Ed finds himself sitting on the goat’s back, looking down at the steep drop with a mix of gratitude and exhaustion. He muses, "OH, MY GOOTNESS, SMILIN’ ED—VE ARE SO LUCKY! SOMEBODY LEFT A TOBOGGAN LYING HERE. NOW VE DON’T HAVE TO WALK!" The man in gray, still clinging to the rope, echoes his relief, saying, "I HOPE I CAN SIT ON IT!" Below, Froggy, Midnight, and Squeaky are climbing back up, with Froggy declaring, "EVEN I CAN’T GET UP THERE—I’M GOIN’ HOME!" The goat, still holding the rope with its horns, stands firm, a silent hero in the midst of the chaos.
The story takes a wild turn as the group discovers a toboggan left on the slope. Smilin' Ed, ever the optimist, takes charge, positioning himself on the toboggan while the others scramble to join him. Froggy, grinning widely, anchors the front with a rope, saying, "I’M AFRAID THIS TOBOGGAN WILL GO TOO FAST. I’D BETTER ANCHOR IT." The man in gray, now seated behind Smilin' Ed, adds, "IT’S GOOD TOO—I’D BETTER ANCHOR IT." With the group piled onto the toboggan, the mountain goat gives a final nudge, sending them sliding down the slope at breakneck speed, their laughter and shouts echoing against the snowy peaks.
