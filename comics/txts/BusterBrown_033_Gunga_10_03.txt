Babu, in a red loincloth, desperately commands, "BACK, PADMAH! BACK!" as the large cow elephant, Padmah, charges forward. Babu’s raised arm and frantic expression contrast with Padmah’s raised trunk and determined stride, her massive form dominating the scene. 
A narration reads, “BABU RAGES TO AN EMPTY HUT NEAR THE EDGE INSIDE OF THE ELEPHANT YARD AND LUNGES INSIDE…" Babu dashes into a thatched hut, his body seen in a mid-leap stance.
Babu continues to plead, "NO, PADMAH! BACK! BACK!" while the narration notes, "…BUT THERE IS NO STOPPING THE INFURIATED BEAST…" Padmah crashes into the hut, her trunk slamming against the structure. 
The hut’s straw walls begin to splinter under her force.The hut’s collapse is depicted, with the narration stating, "…AND SOON BABU’S FRAIL REFUGE CRUMBLES UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE RAGING ELEPHANT…" Padmah’s powerful charge sends straw and debris flying, her trunk raised in fury. The scene captures the raw strength of the elephant, with the hut reduced to rubble, leaving Babu vulnerable.
The scene concludes with Padmah’s retreat, as the narration reads, "…AND PADMAH GOES BACK TO THE JUNGLE!" Her massive form is seen from behind, trudging into the dense jungle with trees and vines in the foreground. Babu kneels amidst the wreckage, his head bowed in defeat.
