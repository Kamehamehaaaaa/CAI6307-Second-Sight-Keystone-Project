The story picks up with Smilin' Ed and his gang—Froggy the Gremlin, Midnight the Cat, Squeaky the Mouse, and the man in the blue climbing outfit—riding the toboggan down the steep slope at breakneck speed. The group is piled onto the wooden sled, hurtling through the snow with a trail of powdery white behind them. Smilin' Ed, the stout leader in his red and black climbing outfit with a green hat, grips the front, laughing with delight as he exclaims, "AH-HH-HH-H… THIS IS THE WAY I LIKE TO TRAVEL!" Froggy, in his red polka-dotted outfit, sits behind him, grinning widely with a speech bubble that reads, "MY, WE’RE GOING FAST!" The man in the gray climbing ensemble with a red hat adds, "YOU AIN’T SEEN NOTHIN’ YET, SMILIN’! VE’LL REALLY TAKE OFF!" Midnight and Squeaky, clinging on for dear life, chime in with a shared speech bubble, "NICE!" The toboggan races past a lone tree, its speed creating a blur of motion against the rugged mountain peaks in the background.
As the descent continues, the toboggan picks up even more speed, turning into a whirlwind of snow and laughter. The second panel shows the group transformed into a series of snowball-like figures, tumbling down the slope in a chaotic heap. Their limbs and accessories—hats, ropes, and ice picks—stick out from the rolling snowballs, capturing the absurdity of their uncontrolled ride. The snowy landscape whizzes by, with pine trees and distant mountains adding to the sense of motion and wild abandon.
The story reaches its happy ending in the final panel, where the group comes to a stop at the base of the mountain, surrounded by scattered snow and rocks. Froggy lies face-first in the snow, his legs sticking up comically as he shakes off the tumble, while Midnight and Squeaky emerge nearby, looking dazed but amused. A text box at the top declares, "AND SO THE MOUNTAIN CLIMB ENDED HAPPILY AND EVERYONE HAD A GRAND TIME." The man in the gray outfit sits up, brushing snow off his hat, while Smilin' Ed, ever the optimist, stands with a grin, ready to embrace the next adventure. Midnight, with her red bow tie slightly askew, and Squeaky, still in his striped shirt, join in the laughter, turning the chaotic climb into a memory of fun and camaraderie.
