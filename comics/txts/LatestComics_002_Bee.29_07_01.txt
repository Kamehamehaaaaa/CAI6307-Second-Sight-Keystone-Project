In the foreground, a caricature of a Japanese man, identifiable by the rising sun symbol on the back of his pants, is depicted crawling awkwardly on his hands and knees across a field. His expression is one of surprise or discomfort, with wide eyes and a grimace, as he looks back over his shoulder. Above him, a squadron of anthropomorphic bees, drawn to resemble military aircraft in formation, flies through the sky. The lead bee, dressed in a blue outfit with goggles, shouts from a speech bubble, "CALLING ALL BEES! TARGET AHEAD!" as the group of bees trails behind in a tight, arrow-like line.
The scene is framed within a large, circular panel, with a cloudy sky and a green hill dotted with red flowers in the background. The ground beneath the man has a few scattered red spots, possibly hinting at an exaggerated or humorous consequence. The title "BEE-29" is boldly displayed at the top in large, black letters on a yellow background, suggesting a playful or wartime theme.
In the lower part of the image, the comic continues with three smaller panels. In the first, the lead bee, still in flight, remarks with a curious tone, "HM! SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT GUY!" as it peers down at the crawling man. The second panel shifts to a lush, green landscape with dense foliage, where the same man, now wearing a suit and tie, stumbles forward with a panicked expression, exclaiming, "AH! HERE IT IS!" His arms are outstretched as if reacting to something unexpected. In the third panel, the bee from before, still pursuing, hovers nearby with a puzzled "?" in a speech bubble, adding to the comedic tension as it watches the man's reaction.
