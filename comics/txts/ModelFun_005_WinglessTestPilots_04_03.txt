The old man continues his narration of his experience with pilot testing and says “AND THEY CALLED THOSE THE GOOD OLD DAYS-HAA! BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. WE USE MODELS FIRST…” The panel shows different kind of models used. It shows SCALE MODELS, and mentions scale models spend tens of thousands of hours in wind tunnels! Next DROP-TEST MODELS, which are often rocket propelled and equipped with telemetering radio, and have collected data on supersonic flight without risk to human pilots! And last comes the description of RADIO-CONTROLLED MODELS which have faithfully reproduced every characteristic of their full-size counterparts in free-flight.
The next panel shows two men examining a model plane and the old man continues his narration “FROM SWEDEN COMES NEWS OF THE FIRST USE OF CONTROL-LINE MODELS BY THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY. ALTOGETHER SEVEN MODELS WERE USED FOR THE TESTS… ALL MODELS WERE MAGE OF LIGHT METAL AND BUILD TO 1/7-SCALE. THEY WERE POWERED BY A PULSE-JET ENGINE OF 5 1/2 POUNDS THRUST.” The panel shows a man flying a model plane with strings tied to it.
The old man continues, “THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS PROVED THE HITHERTO UNKNOWN PRACTICABILITY OF THE UNIQUE “DOUBLE DELTA” WING CONFIGURATION!”
A man who looks like a air Marshal is seen explaining about double delta wing to his subordinates and says “THE DOUBLE DELTA WING COMBINES MOST OF THE ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR SWEPT, CRESCENT AND DELTA WINGS, WITH FEW OF THEIR DISADVANTAGES.”
The next panel shows a SAAB-210 DRAKEN aircraft the old man narrates “ALTHOUGH ACCUMULATING ONLY 22 MINUTES OF LFYING TIME, THE MODELS LED TO THE SWEDISH SAAB-210 DRAKEN RESEARCH AIRCRAFT WHICH HAS ENJOYED EXTRA-ORDINARY SUCCESS!”
