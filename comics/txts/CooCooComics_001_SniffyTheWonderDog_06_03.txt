The shopkeeper in a green suit calculates, "LESSEE—AT TEN CENTS A POUND… THAT’LL BE TWO DOLLARS! SHALL I WRAP HIM UP?" as he holds Sniffy. The man with his hat tilted back, says, "NO… I’LL TAKE HIM! HE MIGHT SMOTHER!!"
The man asked, "HAS HE GOT A PEDIGREE?" and the shopkeeper, smoking a pipe replies, "A REAL BLUE-BLOOD! HIS MOTHER ONCE GAVE A TRANSFUSION TO A FOUNTAIN PEN!!"
The shopkeeper is relieved, exclaiming, "YIPPEE! HE’S OUT OF MY LIFE!!" as the customer coos, "KITCHY-KOO!" to Sniffy. 
The customer is seen at a house door, warning, "REMEMBER… BE NICE TO MY WIFE… SHE HATES DOGS!" as he cradles Sniffy in his arm.
The man and the dog are shown to be thrown out on the floor, with someone from inside the house saying, "NO ANIMALS… ESPECIALLY DOGS! SEE?" with a "ZIP-PP!" sound effect as they are thrown out. 
The man is seen convincing his wife with the words, "BUT HE’S SUCH A SWEET, GENTLE DOG, DEAR!!" The wife, in a red-and-white striped dress, replying with a thoughtful "HMM… HE IS CUTE” 
The wife, now affectionate, cooing, "ITCHY-KOO… MOMMA!" as Sniffy thinks, "APPLE!" with a playful expression.
