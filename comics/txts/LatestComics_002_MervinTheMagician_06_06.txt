The scene unfolds with a group of animal characters—a pig, a wolf, a sheep, and a cat—watching the performance with a mix of concern and amusement. The pig, growing restless, shouts, "WHY DON’T YOU KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE COFFIN ON THE STAGE?" while another character snaps back, "AIN’T NOBODY COUGHING ON STAGE!" The green coffin on stage hints at the ongoing trick, but chaos quickly erupts when Mervin, in the midst of sawing the coffin, accidentally nicks his hand, leaping back in pain with a loud "YEOW!" Stars and money swirl around him, emphasizing the frantic energy as his expression shifts between shock and determination.
Realizing the mishap has landed him in hot water, Mervin’s panic intensifies as he exclaims, "OH OH! HERE’S WHERE I GO BACK TO JAIL!" His wide eyes and raised hands signal surrender, surrounded by stars that highlight his distress. Sure enough, a stern police officer pig grabs him by the arm, dragging him offstage. Mervin, still clutching his saw, tries to lighten the mood, saying, "OKAY, I’M COMING QUIETLY! HEY, DO YA WANNA BREAK MY SAW?" His jester hat tilts comically, but the officer remains unamused.
Soon, Mervin finds himself behind bars, sitting thoughtfully as two small mice watch him with curiosity. He mutters, "THERE MUST BE SOME WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS JOINT, HMM!" But Mervin’s spirits lift when a mischievous idea strikes. With a sly grin, he pulls out a stick of dynamite, exclaiming, "LUCKY I ALWAYS CARRY AN EXTRA STICK OF DYNAMITE! I’M SMART, EH?" The background shifts to a cityscape, hinting at his bold escape plan as the episode ends on a thrilling cliffhanger, leaving the audience eager to see what happens next in Mervin’s magical misadventures!
