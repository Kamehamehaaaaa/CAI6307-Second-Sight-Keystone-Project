A grown up man and his  kid named Allie are seen talking. The grown up man asks  Allie about a letter he got from his school “ALLIE - I JUST GOT A LETTER FROM YOUR TEACHER TELLING ME THAT YOU WERE THROWING SPITBALLS! IS THAT TRUE?” Allie replies “YES– IT'S TRUE, ON ACCOUNT OF IT’S WRONG FOR ME TO TELL A LIE!”
In the next panel Allie’s dad says “THAT’S RIGHT – NOW THEN – DON’T YOU KNOW IT’S VERY DANGEROUS TO THROW SPITBALLS?” to which Allie responds “NO, PAPA!”
Allie’s dad explains to him why it's dangerous by saying “LOOK – YOUR MOUTH IS FULL OF GERMS!” to which Allie replies “IT IS?”
In the next panel Allie’s dad goes on to explain “CERTAINLY! AND WHEN YOU WET A SPITBALL WITH YOUR MOUTH AND THROW IT, YOU’RE ACTUALLY SPREADING THOUSANDS OF GERMS!”
Allie’s dad asks Allie to promise that he won’t throw spitballs by saying “NOW, WILL YOU PROMISE ME YOU WON’T THROW ANY MORE SPITBALLS?”. Allie replies with a serious face “NO PAPA – I WILL THROW SPITBALLS – ONLY FIRST I WILL WASH MY MOUTH!” 
Allie’s dad raises his hands in the air and says “I GIVE UP!”.
