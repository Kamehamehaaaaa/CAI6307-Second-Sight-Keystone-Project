In a thrilling conclusion to this wartime comic, Farmer Gray, sitting at a table, suddenly leaps from his chair with a startled "YIPE!" as Bee 29 stings him, stars bursting around him to emphasize the sharp pain. Still reeling, Farmer Gray, now standing with a grimace, demands, "B-29, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?" while swatting at the air with a fly swatter, shouting, "WATCH OUT FOR THAT FLY!" as Bee 29, in its blue cape, dodges the swing. Farmer Gray, gripping the swatter with determination, explains, "IF THAT PESKY FLY IS ALL YOU’RE WORRIED ABOUT I TAKES CARE OF HIM!" and with a swift motion, he smacks the chief fly, eliminating the deadly threat in a burst of motion lines.
Bee 29, hovering nearby, reveals the gravity of the situation, saying, "THAT WAS A DEADLY GERM-CARRYING JAP FLY!" confirming the enemy’s defeat but also hinting at the bee’s own impending fate due to the mortal germ it may have contracted. Farmer Gray, now relieved, holds Bee 29 gently in his hand, exclaiming, "WHEW! SAVED FROM DEATH BY A STING IN THE PANTS!" a mix of gratitude and humor in his tone as he scratches his head, still processing the ordeal.
The scene shifts to a celebratory moment as the bee queen, adorned in a red gown and crown, honors Bee 29, declaring, "FOR SERVICE ABOVE AND BEE-YOND THE CALL OF DUTY! YOU’RE A HONEY!" while presenting a medal with the words "YOU’RE A HONEY" inscribed on it. Bee 29 stands proudly, surrounded by cheering bees, their tiny wings buzzing with excitement as they celebrate its bravery and sacrifice in protecting the community from the enemy threat. The comic blends wartime heroism with whimsical humor, highlighting Bee 29’s selfless act to save the day.
