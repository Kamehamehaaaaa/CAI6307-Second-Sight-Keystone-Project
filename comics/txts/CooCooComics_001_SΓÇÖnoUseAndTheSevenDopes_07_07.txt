Still outside, the dopes see the Queen and Prince Charming approaching on the latter’s horse. One says, “LOOK, FELLOW DOPES! PRINCE CHARMING!” Another says, “WHO’S TH’ LADY - -I MEAN WITCH!” The tire horse pants under the weight of two people on its back.
A Dope asks, “HULLO, PRINCE CHARMING! WHERE YOU GOING WITH THAT BEAST AND I DON’T MEAN THE HORSE?” The horse thanks him, “THENKS, CHUM!” The Queen shouts indignantly, “WOT!”
The Dope continues, “WE HAVE THE REAL PRINCESS AT OUR HOUSE! THIS PHONEY IS A QUEEN!” Prince Charming is confused and wonders, “WHICH IS BETTER?” The Queen silently questions the dope, too.
The Dope answers, “A PRINCESS - LIKE WE HAVE!” Prince Charming is convinced, saying “OKAY, I’M COMING. BYE, QUEEN!”, and the Queen falls off his horse, making a “WAP!” sound, saying “RATS!”
In a circular panel, S’no Use meets Prince Charming. She exclaims, “IT’S PRINCE CHARMING!” A Dope thinks, “NOW HE’LL TAKE HER AWAY… GOODY!” Prince Charming smiles, “SHUT MY MOUF’!”
A narration box explains the ending, “BUT THE PRINCE AND S’NO USE STAYED WITH THE SEVEN DOPES - - AND THEY LIVED DISCONTENTEDLY EVER AFTER!” From the Dopes’ kitchen, S’no Use calls, “SUPPER IS READY!” Grey smoke wafts in clouds and a stream from the aperture leading there from the dining room. Seated at the table, Prince Charming puts a palm to his forehead and cries, “OH-OH!” A dope rises from the table, saying “NO… PLEASE.” Another has already ran through the open window behind the table, leaving only a cloud of dust in his trail. He says, “I EXPECT A STOMACHACHE” Prince Charming’s horse turns away from the kitchen and says, “EXCUSE ME!”. The final narration says, “END.”
