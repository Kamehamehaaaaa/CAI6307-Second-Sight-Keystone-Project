The narration reads, "AS FINNY ADVANCES BACKWARD, FATE TAKES A HAND IN THE GUISE OF A PEEVISH CRAB…", introducing a crab behind Finny. 
Finny is pinched by the crab, crying "OUCH!" And Finny jumps in pain and smashing into the dragon's face, and in the background Gertie is seen observing all this hiding behind a tree. 
Finny apologizes, "FORGIVE ME, MR. DWAGON! I DIDN’T MEAN TO BUMP YOU! I—" as the dragon is seen fallen on the floor unconscious. 
Finny’s triumph is captured, "GOOD SWAY! I KNOCKED HIM OUT!" as he is seen surprised.
Finny reassures his friends, "YOU CAN STOP HIDING NOW—YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE AFRAID—THE DWAGON’S OUT COLD!" with a curious "HUH!" as others are seen hiding under a tree. 
Spike boasts, "YES! I GUESS WE BEAT THE BIG LUMMOX! BRAINS OVER BRAWN, DAT’S ME PITCHER, JOHNNY!" while Johnny warns, "DON’T LOOK NOW, SPIKE, BUT I THINK THE CRITTER’S WAKIN’ UP!" In the last panel.
