Jasper and Wilbur tamper with their father’s alarm clock. Jasper says “IT’S ALL SET TO GO OFF. QUICK, BACK TO BED!”
The alarm clock goes off, “R-RRINGG!”, and the clapper striking its bell causes the clock to vibrate so violently it jumps from the table.
Buster Bruin sits up in bed, eyes wide with surprise, questioning “HUH?”
He is delighted, saying “AHHH! SPRING! I FEEL GREAT! NOTHING LIKE A GOOD LONG NAP!” as he dances out of bed.
He runs to the door saying, midstride “NOW TO GET SOME SUN AGAIN- - - -” as he reaches for the doorknob.
Just as he opens the door, we see from outside that a snow drift falls on Buster Bruin’s head from atop the door. He is crushed beneath it and shouts “HEY!! W-WHAT TH- -!”
Now Jasper and Wilbur are delighted in the background, smiling widely. Their father sits on a wooden chair in the foreground with his feet in a basin of warm water and a compress on his head. Around him are jugs and boxes. One is labeled “PILLS” another “COLD PILLS” Buster Bruin grunts and sneezes at once, “HAR-UMPH! KER-CHOO!”
