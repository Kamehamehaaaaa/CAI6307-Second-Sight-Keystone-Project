Herbert, while walking away, suddenly turns around as he hears a cry "HELP!" 
Herbert then stands on a rock peering into the distance, "HELP!” Is heard once again while Herbert thinks,  “SURE ENOUGH—THERE’S SOMEBODY DROWNIN’—AN’ I CAN’T SWIM!!" 
Herbert has sudden inspiration, "IDEA!" with a lightbulb above his head, hinting at a plan, while he hears the cry for help. There is a sign, "FREE PARKING WALK AND SAVE TIRES" near a car.
Herbert rushes toward the car, shouting "I’LL SAVE YA LADY!" with determination. 
The scene returns to the sign "FREE PARKING WALK AND SAVE TIRES" as Herbert kneels by the car, adjusting a tire.
