Bele Kahr floats above Karim and Jafarah, as though he were stepping on air, the cloud of smoke is behind him with three faces peeing out of it in Karim’s direction. Karim kneels, but Jafara aids him by holding together the knot of the leathern thong. Jafara says, “THERE, KARIM.. YOUR POWER HAS RETURNED! CALL UPON THE CORD!” Karim obeys, “I CALL UPON THE GOOD POWERS OF THE LEATHERN CORD, BOUND BY THE KNOT OF GOOD WILL!”
From a cloud of Karim’s own, birds emerge; and Bele Kahr regards his foe again.
Bele Kahr has shrunk with the spirits into a smaller rust-colored cloud of smoke. Karim, Myrrah,, Jafara, and the Caliph stand away from them. Karim remarks, “THE FORCES OF EVIL ARE GONE FOREVER TAKING WITH THEM THE EVIL ONE BELE KAHR!”
The Caliph holds one cupped hand up to chest, saying “MAY ALLAH BLESS YOU, MY CHILDREN!” Jafarah says, “AT LEAST HE COULD LOAN ME THE LEATHERN CORD TO WISH FOR SOME SWEETMEATS.. I’M HUNGRY!”
