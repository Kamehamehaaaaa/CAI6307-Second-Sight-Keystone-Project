Pete and Joe, both in green military uniforms and helmets, are seen standing side by side as Pete passionately declares, "AND, JOE, I MADE UP MY MIND: I’M GOIN’ T’ SEND THAT KID SOMETHIN’ THAT HE CAN REALLY BE PROUD OF FOR HIS BIRTHDAY! I’M GOIN’ OUT AND WIN A MEDAL FOR WILLIE!" Joe, with a more grounded expression, counters skeptically, "YUH JUST DON’T GO OUT AND WIN A MEDAL! IT’S IMPOSSIBLE! WHEN YUH LEAST EXPECT ONE… THAT’S WHEN YUH GET IT—OUT OF A CLEAR BLUE SKY!" 
Sergeant Mulvaney,  stands near a tree holding a letter with a furrowed brow, wondering, "NOW WHY WOULD A PHILADELPHIA DEPARTMENT STORE SEND ME A CIRCULAR…?" as a curious soldier nearby, leaning in with a smirk, teases, "HEY, SARGE, WHAT’D YUH GET? A LETTER FROM SOME GAL, EH?" 
The sergeant whose face is lit with a playful grin, boasts, "YEAH, WELL… YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, JOE… ONCE THOSE WOMEN FIND OUT WHERE YOU ARE—THEY NEVER LET YOU ALONE… HEH, HEH…”. The soldier responds back saying, “GEE, I WISH I KNEW HOW TO HANDLE WOMEN LIKE YOU, SARGE! I “GOT ME A REAL PROBLEM HERE” 
In the backdrop of military tents, the soldier narrates his problem, "SUSIE’S BIRTHDAY IS COMIN’ UP… AND I AIN’T GOT ANYTHIN’ TO SEND HER FOR A PRESENT! SHE ALREADY GOT WAR SWORDS AND CAPTURED BOOKS AND SILK SCARVES and …” Mulvaney, rubbing his chin, promises Joe a solution for Susie’s birthday gift, saying, “MY BOY, THAT IS A WEIGHTY PROBLEM! BUT I TELL YUH WHAT, LET OLD DADDY MULVANEY THINK IT OUT! T’MORROW I PROMISE YUH A SOLUTION!" 
As soon as the soldier starts thanking the sergeant with, “GEE, SARGE, I SURE APPRECIATE …” is interrupted by Mulvaney saying, "TUT, TUT, M’BOY, NOTHIN’ AT ALL! WITH MY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THESE MATTERS IT WILL BE A CINCH… JUST LEAVE ME A FEW HOURS TO THINK IT OVER QUIETLY…" 
A narration reads, “BUT THAT EVENING”, signaling the time of day, an officer, standing amid shadows, commands, "MULVANEY, TAKE YOUR SQUAD TO POINT X-RAY ON THE DOUBLE! ‘CHARLIE’ AND ‘DOG’ PLATOONS ARE IN SKIRMISH THERE! PRIVATE BURCH, I WANT YOU AND CIRILLO TO LAY WIRE EAST AND CONNECT UP WITH BATTALION HEADQUARTERS!" A soldier with a rifle on his back, responds sharply, "RIGHT, SIR!" signaling the battlefield’s urgency.
