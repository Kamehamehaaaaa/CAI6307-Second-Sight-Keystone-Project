The story kicks off with a cheerful young girl named Mary, accompanied by her fluffy little lamb, Lester, standing outside a quaint brick butcher shop. The air is filled with playful tension as Lester declares, "NIX, MARY! I’LL FOLLOW YOU BUT NOT IN THERE!" with a determined tone, clearly wary of the shop’s sign boasting "SPECIAL TODAY: LAMB CHOPS." Mary holds a piece of paper, her companion by her side, and the scene echoes the nursery rhyme "Mary Had a Little Lamb" with the text singing, "MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB AS SNOW, AND EVERYWHERE THAT MARY WENT THE LAMB WAS THERE ALSO!"
As the tale unfolds, Mary’s excitement shines through as she exclaims, "GEE, I’M GLAD MOMMY WROTE DOWN I’D NEVER REMEMBER THEM ALL!" while showing Lester a list, likely her chores or reminders. Lester, with a puzzled yet hopeful expression, pleads, "CAN’T I GO WITH YOU, HUH? CAN I, HUH?" Mary, ever the negotiator, responds, "ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU MUST PROMISE TO BEHAVE THIS TIME!" to which Lester innocently replies, "WHO? ME?" The story wraps up with a joyful scene of Mary running off, her red dress fluttering, with Lester bounding happily behind her, a haircut note in hand, leaving the butcher shop far behind. Their playful bond and lighthearted escape bring a warm conclusion to this whimsical tale!
