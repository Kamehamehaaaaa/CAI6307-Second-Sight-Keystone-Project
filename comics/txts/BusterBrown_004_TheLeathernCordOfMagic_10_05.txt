A textbox narrates, “AND THAT NIGHT MYRRAH GUIDED JAFARRA AND KARIM TO THE SLEEPING CHAMBERS OF HER FATHER, THE CALIPH, … HIDDEN BEHIND HEAVY DRAPES, THEY WATCHED AS THE WAZIR, THE MAGICIAN, BELE KAHR, ENTERED AND BEGAN PREPARING A MIXTURE IN HIS GLASSES AND RETORTS….”
The Caliph’s bedroom has blue walls, decorated with a pair of golden swords; a pink floor; and green drapes parted to show Myrrah’s orange dress. One of the trio says, “LOOK! HE HAS PREPARED A MIXTURE! SLOW POISON I’LL WAGER!” Myrrah replies, “BUT.. HE’S GOING TO GIVE IT TO MY FATHER! WHAT CAN WE DO?!” A green-garbed figure on the right side of the panel stands over the bed, where another lays at rest. It holds the smoking mixture in its hand.
With a sword in one hand, Karim shouts, appearing with Myrrah and Jafara from behind the drapes, “DROP THE GLASS OF POISON, BELE KAHR!” Bele Kahr, wearing a green tunic with a darker green belt and a green turban, addresses Karim, “YOU! FREED FROM THE SPELL! BUT YOU WERE A FOOL TO COME HERE!”
Myrrah holds Karim back and warns him, “QUICKLY, KARIM! OUT THE WINDOW AND CLIMB TO THE ROOF! THEY WILL COME HERE, AND ALSO THEY WILL LOOK FOR YOU IN THE COURTYARD! ON THE ROOF YOU WILL BE SAFE, UNTIL YOU CAN PLAN FURTHER!” Jafara agrees, “HURRY KARIM! I HEAR THE GUARDS COMING!” Bele Kahr dashes through an open yellow bedroom door, shouting “GUARDS!”
