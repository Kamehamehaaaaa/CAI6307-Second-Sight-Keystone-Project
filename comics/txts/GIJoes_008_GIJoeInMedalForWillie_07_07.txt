A narration, “"A FEW MINUTES LATER INSIDE CAPTAIN KING’S FIELD SHACK” is seen. Captain King, his uniform crisp, speaks to a superior officer on Pete’s bravery, stating, “… AND IF HE HADN’T DELAYED THEM TANKS, KNOWN’ IT WAS PURE SUICIDE, THEY WOULD HAVE HIT OUR LINE WHILE I WAS STILL OUT COLD!" 
Burch, his face earnest, advocates for Pete: "SIR, YOU PROMISED ME A BRONZE STAR, AND I’M TELLIN’ YUH THE GUY WHO DESERVES IT THE WAR IS OVER FOR PETE. ARE YOU GONNA SEND HIM BACK TO HIS KID WITH JUST A PAIR OF GAME LEGS?" Captain King agrees, "IT’S OPEN AND SHUT, BURCH! CIRILLO DESERVES THAT MEDAL!" 
Joe, in a medical tent, stands beside Pete’s cot, beams with relief, saying, "GEE, JOE! I’M GLAD TO SEE YUH! I THOUGHT THEY GOT YUH!" Pete, bandaged but smiling, replies, "NAAH, THEY GOT T’ USE HEAVIER BULLETS THAN THAT IF THEY WANT T’DENT THIS OLD SKULL! YUH DIDN’T EVEN TELL YUH THE BEST NEWS, CAPTAIN KING IS PUTTIN’ YOU IN FOR THE BRONZE STAR!" 
Joe, overwhelmed, exclaims, "GOSH… JOE, A BRONZE STAR! (GULP) GEE, MY KID’LL BE SO PROUD! IMAGINE THAT… THEY’RE GIVING ME A MEDAL!" Joe, supportive, adds, "AND YOU SURE DESERVE IT, PETE! WILLIE CAN REALLY BE PROUD OF HIS OLD MAN! YOU BETTER GET SOME REST NOW!" 
Joe playfully reminds Pete of his earlier promise: "HEY JOE, REMEMBER I SAID I’D SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM FOR YOU? WELL I DID! ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SEND SUSIE THAT BRONZE STAR WON… WHAT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT!" Joe, surprised, corrects him, "STAR? I… UH… WHO TOLD YOU I WAS GETTIN’ A STAR? THAT’S SCUTTLEBUTT! THEY GAVE THE STAR TO PETE… THE GUY THAT DESERVES IT!" 
The Sergeant questions Joe, “DON’T HAND ME THAT! I KNOW WHAT YOU DONE! VERY FINE… ALL RIGHT! SO WHAT ARE YOU GOIN’ TO SEND SUSIE?”, to which he replies, “WHA—? WHY I… I… I’LL SEND HER LOVE ‘N’ KISSES! JOE LIKES US DON’T WIN MEDALS, YUH YUH GOTTA BE A REAL HERO!
Joe, now standing under a moonlit sky, smoking a cigarette, thinking, "WHAT A GUY!” The page concludes with "The End”.
