A steamship, the Swift, larger than either the Sea Hawk or the Island Queen approaches the two schooners from the left. It billows a black cloud of smoke into the air. Narration explains, “AFTER 24 HOURS OF HARD WORK, KALA AND CHAD SLEEP SOUNDLY, UNAWARE OF THEIR RAPIDLY APPROACHING VISITORS… NEXT TO THE ‘SEA HAWK’ FLOATS THE ‘ISLAND QUEEN’, THE MYSTERIOUS SHIP….”
Beau Dillion and Ham Stone storm aboard the Sea Hawk with a third man, holding tommy guns with drum barrels. Beau Dillion rallies, “COME ON BOYS! WE’VE TAKEN THEM BY SURPRIZE…” Kala leans out of the door to the cabin. He looks up a set of stairs to an orange door. Chad rises out of bed and puts a hand to his forehead just as the voice of Beau Dillion calls from the deck, “OKAY, BELOW! UP AND OUTTA THERE! OR WE BLAST THE ‘SEA HAWK’ TO SLIVERS!... TWO MACHINE GUNS ON YA, SO COME UP!!”
Chad’s silhouette looks up at Beau Dillion’s legs while an islander peeks out of a hatch on the Sea Hawk’s deck. Beau Dillion orders, “WHERE’S THE KID? HAM… GO BELOW AND ROUT HIM OUT…” Chad tries to convince Beau Dillion, “KALA?! WHY, HE’S GONE ASHORE… I’M SURE!”
Ham Stone’s voice emanates from the cabin through a set of open french doors, “HE AIN’T IN THE CABIN, BEAU! HE MUST BE ASHORE!” Beau Dillion holds his gun to Chad’s chest while an island stands balancing on the Sea Hawk’s railing and white smoke rises in a cloud from the background. Beau Dillion barks orders to his men, “OKAY! POST A MAN ON DECK TO GET HIM WHEN HE COMES BACK! C’MON, BILLOW, OVER ON THE ‘SWIFT.’ AND MAKE IT FAST!”
