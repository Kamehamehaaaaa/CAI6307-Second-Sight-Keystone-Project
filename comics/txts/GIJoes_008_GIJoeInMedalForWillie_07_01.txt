The scene opens with a narration stating, “WHEN THE BATTALION POSTMASTER’S JEEP PULLED INTO THE ‘B’ COMPANY AREA, THERE WAS PLENTY OF WHOOPING AND HOLLERING - - MAIL FROM HOME! JOE GOT A LETTER FORM SUSIE, PRIVATE PETE CIRILLO GOT ONE FROM HIS WIFE - WITH SNAPSHOTS. EVEN SERGEANT MULVANEY GOT ONE-A PHILADELPHIA DEPARTMENT STORE CIRCULAR! BUT OF ALL THE GUYS, PETE WAS THE HAPPIEST … “. 
A typical military camp is shown, with tents pitched for the soldiers. It showcases in the background a group of soldiers crowded around the Battalion Postmaster’s jeep who is calling out names “HENDRICKS… HENSHAW… JAKOWSKY… LAWTON…” to hand them their letters. Pete, clad in a military uniform and helmet, calls out to Joe, “HEY, JOE! WAIT A MINUTE! I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING!”. Joe, who was busy reading his letter, looks back at Pete. 
Pete’s face glows with happiness as he reads aloud from his wife Mary’s letter: "MARY SAYS HERE… ‘WILLIAM IS GETTING BIGGER EVERY DAY WHEN DADDY IS COMING HOME, AND I WONDER AND PRAY TOO, DARLING…’ WELL, THE REST IS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, PRIVATE!" Joe, smiling warmly, replies, "GEE, HE SURE IS A GOOD-LOOKING KID, PETE! HOW OLD IS HE?". 
Pete’s excitement peaks as he exclaims, "OH, LITTLE WILLIE IS GOIN’ ON SIX YEARS OLD ALREADY! HE AIN’T NO BABY ANY MORE! YEAH, END OF THIS MONTH HE’LL BE SIX!" The picture reveals a photo of young Willie with a missing tooth, saluting in a checkered shirt with a house, clouds, and trees behind him, held in Pete’s hand.
