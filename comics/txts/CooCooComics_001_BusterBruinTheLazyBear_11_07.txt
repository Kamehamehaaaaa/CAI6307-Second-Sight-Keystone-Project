The cubs run away from the chair their father now sleeps in. The grey one says to the brown one, “C’MON, JASPER - POP’S ASLEEP!” Jasper cries with excitement, “OH, BOY!”
Outside, the two cubs run over the snow toward a sheer cliff face. Jasper says, “I KNOW- -”
Climbing the sheer cliff up toward a snow drift that blankets its peak, the cubs shout in unison “-- EAGLES’ EGGS”
Buster Bruin wakes, stilling sat up in the chair of logs, but is in a stupor. He questions, “HUH?”
Suddenly he realizes and searches frantically for the cubs, “GOODNESS - - WHERE ARE THE KIDS?” 
He looks beneath the bed he slept in previously, calling to the boys, “YOO-HOO! JASPER! WILBUR!”
Buster Bruin runs from the house, saying “OMIGOSH - - - I BET THEY’RE OUT CLIMBING TREES!”
