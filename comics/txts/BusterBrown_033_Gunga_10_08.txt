The narration sets the scene, "FEARLESSLY THE YOUNG MAHOUT WORKS HIS WAY UNNOTICED THROUGH THE GRAZING HERD SEEKING THE RUNAWAY COW ELEPHANT." Gunga, crouches low amidst the herd, his figure barely visible beneath a towering elephant. The herd grazes peacefully, their massive forms framed by trees and grass, emphasizing Gunga’s stealth and the danger of his task.
The narration marks a turning point, "AT LAST HE FINDS PADMAH!" Gunga kneels before Padmah as she stands among the herd. His focused expression and proximity to her legs highlight the moment of recognition.
The narration notes, "GUNGA QUICKLY FASTENS THE KEDDAH HOOK WITH PRACTICED HANDS…" Gunga, now under Padmah, expertly attaches a keddah hook to her leg. His practiced hands and determined pose contrast with Padmah’s massive form, her trunk and tusks looming above. The jungle floor, dotted with grass and plants, frames the action, underscoring the precision required.
The resolution is delivered with the narration, "…AND PADMAH IS CAPTURED!" Gunga stands triumphantly, holding the rope attached to Padmah’s leg as she stands subdued.
