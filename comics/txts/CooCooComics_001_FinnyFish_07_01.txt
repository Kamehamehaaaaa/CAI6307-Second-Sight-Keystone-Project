Finny Fish, drawn large, greets readers with a cheerful, "HIYA, FOLKS! MY NAME’S FINNY FISH! I DON’T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF SO I’LL JUST LET YOU READ MY STORY!" his wide grin and outstretched arms inviting the audience.
Finny Fish is seen standing behind an orange fence and Spike saying, "HERE COMES DAT WISE BUY, FINNY FISH! HURRY! BLOW UP DE RUBBER DUMBELL AND WELL HAVE SOME FUN WIT HIM!" as Johnny, a small orange character with a cap, eagerly responds, "SURE TING!" while inflating a rubber dumbbell with a pump, setting the stage for a prank. 
Finny Fish encounters Spike, who boasts, "HI, FINNY! LOOKIN’ WHAT JOHNNY’s LIFTIN’—A 1000 POUND DUMBELL! COURSE I CAN LIFT DAT ONE WIT’ ME PINKY—I USE A TWO TON WEIGHT FOR MY WORKOUTS" while Johnny is seen holding an oversized weight labeled "1000." Nearby, Finny Fish, a smaller frog-like figure, exclaims, "GWACIOUS!" in surprise, adding to the comedic exaggeration.
