In the first panel, the narrator describes that the Hobby shop dealer willfully joins Will in his plan. Mr. Miller describes the plane is strong enough to carry loads like the serum and says, “THIS IS A HIGH POWERED JOB, AND SHOULD FLY OVER THE RIVER, EVEN WITH A HEAVY LOAD LIKE YOUR SERUM, DOC.”. To which the doctor replies “WELL IT BETTER MAKE IT THIS IS MY LAST SERUM TUBE!”. 
In the next panel, Mr.Miller conveys that it's getting dark and without a light source on the model plane it would be difficult to see it in the dark on the other side of the shore. Mr.Miller says, “GEE, ITS GETTING AWFUL DARK… MAYBE THEY WON’T SEE THE PLANE ON THE OTHER SIDE”, and suggests that “I KNOW LET’S LASH THE PENCIL TYPE FLASHLIGHT TO THE PLANE.”.
The model plane is shown airborne and Mr.Miller says “THERE SHE GOES… LOOK AT THAT POWER!”. 
The darkness made it difficult to determine if the plane reached the other side, to which Will says “I CAN’T MAKE IT OUT ANYMORE… IT’S TOO DARK!”. The doctor being optimistic about the plane suggests that the plane might still be airborne and says “IT MUST STILL BE FLYING. LETS SIGNAL THOSE ON THE OTHER SHORE.”
Three men are seen standing on the other side of the shore where the action is about to begin. This is described by the narrator. A man with a blue shirt and a hat acknowledges that he received the message and says “THEY SIGNALLED. A POWER MODEL PLANE IS COMING OVER…”, another man says “HAVEN’T SEEN IT YET.”. “IT’S PRETTY DARK TO SEE ANYTHING” says the third person in the frame. 
The man in the blue shirt pointing towards the sky indicates that he sees the plane and says “IT’S PASSING OVER US… IT’S TOO HIGH OVER HEAD…”
