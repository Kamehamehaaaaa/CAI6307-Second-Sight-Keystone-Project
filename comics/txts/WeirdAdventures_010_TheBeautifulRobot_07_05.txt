Professor John runs out onto the terrace, following Barbara’s directions, shouting “KATHA! STOP! STOP KISSING JIM! DO YOU HEAR? STOP!!” Jim Drake is held up by Katha, and she continues to kiss him although he has only one foot placed tenuously on the ground and he shakes his arms violently.
A narration box, “COWED BY PROFESSOR KINGSLEY’S SHARP TONES, THE BEAUTIFUL ROBOT RELEASES HER PREY. LATER.” Professor John points to and shakes a finger in the face of Katha, saying “HOW DARE YOU KISS ANOTHER MAN? I OWN YOU! YOU BELONG TO ME!” Katha refuses him, “NO! I DON’T! I WANT JIM! I’M GOING TO HIM NOW!”
Professor John shakes his fists, gripping the jacket of his suit, shouting “NO, YOU’RE NOT! YOU’RE STAYING HERE WITH ME! YOU’RE MY PROPERTY…” Still, Katha refuses, “I WANT JIM, HE IS YOUNG… HANDSOME, YOU ARE OLD… UGLY…”
A narration box hangs over Professor John’s wide-eyed, shocked expression, “STUNG BY THE FAMILIAR WORDS, THE PROFESSOR ABANDONS ALL CAUTION.” Through jagged rows of teeth, Professor John lambasts his creation, “I’LL TELL YOU WHY YOU CAN’T GO TO JIM! BECAUSE HE’S HUMAN! YOU… YOU’RE NOTHING BUT A ROBOT… THAT I CREATED OUT OF SCRAPS OF METAL… A BEAUTIFUL ROBOT, YES… BUT JUST A CONGLOMERATION OF NUTS AND BOLTS, AND SPRINGS…”
He continues, although he is pressed against a wall and his face has turned from anger to fear, “‘LOVE’ IS JUST AN EMPTY WORD TO YOU… A MEANINGLESS STRING OF SYLLABLES I TAUGHT YOU! WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF BURNING EMOTION? NOTHING!!” Katha’s hands stretch out toward him, she says “I KNOW… HATE!”
Katha throttles the professor, gripping his throat with her hands, he struggles and gasps, “NO… ARGHH… STOP… (GASP) PLEASE…. NO!... URGGHHH!!” Looking down on Professor John, Katha yells, “DIE, UGLY OLD… HUMAN!! YOU CREATED ME… ONLY TO MOCK ME!”
