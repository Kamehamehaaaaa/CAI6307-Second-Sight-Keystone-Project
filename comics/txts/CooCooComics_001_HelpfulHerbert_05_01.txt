Herbert, a portly man in a suit and hat,  strolling along a waterbody wonders, "MEBBE IF I TAKE A WALK DOWN TO TH’ BEACH I’LL FIND SOMEBODY THAT NEEDS HELP—I’M ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN I’M HELPIN’ SOMEBODY-" with a cheerful demeanor.
Herbert, comes across offers Betty, a young girl in a swimsuit, "WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BLOW UP YOUR WATER-HORSE, LI’L GIRL?" as a large woman in a similar orange swimsuit says, "LET THE NICE MAN HELP YOU, BETTY!" 
Herbert inflates a water-horse, "IT TAKES A LOTTA WIND T’ BLOW THESE THINGS UP-" as the woman in the orange swimsuit confirms, "YES, IT DOES-" 
The woman warns, "I THINK THAT’S ENOUGH BIG-" as Herbert, gasps, "OH…UGH…I’VE GOT PLENTY…UGH…MORE…WIND!" 
The woman and Betty seem surprised as the water-horse inflates larger than it's supposed to.
