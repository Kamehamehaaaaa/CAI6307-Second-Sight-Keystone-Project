A dark skinned boy with dark hair and robbed in green runs to the side of a taller man with blue hair, a yellow shirt, blue pants and tall leather boots. The boy asks,  “DOGGONE GOOD DINNER, HEY, CHAD? NOW ME GLAD GO ‘BOARD ‘SEA HAWK’.. CATCH PLENTY SLEEP…” Chad replies, “KALA.. ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU’LL BUST YOUR BINNACLE EATIN’ LIKE THAT!” There is a schooner with triangular sails in the background; and below it, there is a tilted, pink narration box, “CHAD BILLOW, YOUNG ADVENTURER, AND HIS YOUNG SIDE-KICK, A POLYNESIAN BOY, WHOM CHAD PICKED UP; AFTER A HURRICANE IN THE SOUTH SEAS, ENJOY A GOOD DINNER ON SHORE, AND HEAD BACK FOR THEIR FORTY-FOOTER, THE “SEA HAWK!”
Kala’s silhouette leans toward Chad, fist clenched, urging, “LOOK. CHAD! TWO MEN… FIGHT UP ONE MAN! HE OLD MAN.. WE HELP HIM?” Chad replies, “WE’LL EVEN UP THE FORCES ANYWAY! KID, COME ON, BUT LOOK SHARP!”
Kala and Chad fight three swarthy men. Kala pouches one across his body with his left hand, Chad lands a left hook on another man’s face. The third man lies unconscious on the floor.
