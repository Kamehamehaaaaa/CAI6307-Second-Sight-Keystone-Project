Buster Bruin rises, with his eyes screwed shut, past Jasper and Wilbur. Jasper waves with an open palm and says, “HI, POP!” Wilbur asks, “WHERE’S HE GOING?”
Buster Bruin screams “WOW!” as his midsection slams into the wall of a cliff so hard it throws up dust. He peers down over his shoulder and does not see a pair of eagles in their nest questioning his appearance.
An eagle becks the crown of Buster Bruin’s head, and he grimaces in pain shouting, “HEY! CUT IT OUT, YOU SQUAB!”
The eagle’s children take offense on their father’s behalf, approaching his hands and saying “HE CALLED POP A SQUAB!” and “I’LL FIX HIM!”
One throws a greenish rock at Buster Bruin’s hands, shouting “THERE,” and causing him to lose his grip on the cliff’s edge. Buster Bruin shouts, “YOW! HALP!”
Buster Bruin is sent falling down the cliface but is able to grab a thin root sticking out of the rock. It nearly snaps with a “CRUNCH” but holds his weight as he says, “GULP! SAVED!”
Buster Bruin looks up to the top of cliff and shouts “YOU KIDS BETTER COME DOWN OFFA THERE!”
Jumping from the cliff, Wilbur and Jasper obey their father’s demand, saying “OKAY, POP - - -” and “- - - HERE WE COME!” as they fall down to him, respectively.
