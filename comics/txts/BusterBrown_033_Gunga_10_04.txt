The narration on top of the page reads, “LATER…” Gunga, with a red turban, questions Babu, "AIE, BABU! PADMAH WENT BERSERK?" Babu, in a red loincloth, responds with a defeated expression, "SHE DID. I COULD NOT CONTROL HER. NOW SHE HAS RUN OFF INTO THE JUNGLE." The scene in the background is the aftermath of Padmah’s rampage. Rama, asserts, "PADMAH IS THE WORST ANIMAL WE CAUGHT IN THE BIG KEDDAH. I DOUBT THAT SHE WILL EVER BE USEFUL!” 
Gunga counters optimistically, "THAT IS NOT TRUE, RAMA, PADMAH CAN BE TRAINED, BUT SHE IS VERY WILD AND HEADSTRONG, AND IT WILL TAKE MUCH TIME AND PATIENCE. WE MUST FOLLOW HER AND BRING HER BACK!" Babu replies, “IT IS USELESS GUNGA. I HAVE FOLLOWED HER EASILY, BUT ALREADY SHE HAS REJOINED A WILD BAND OF ELEPHANTS. HOW CAN WE CAPTURE HER?” The trio stands together, their gestures animated, as they strategize.
Babu laments, "I HAVE LOST A VALUABLE ELEPHANT! NOW I AM FEARFUL OF MY POSITION WITH HIS HIGHNESS," while Gunga reassures him, "YOU HAVE NO NEED TO FEAR. HE KNOWS THAT PADMAH IS A MEAN COW. GO BACK TO THE STABLES AND BRING THAT HUGE COIL OF ROPE WITH THE KEDDAH HOOK ON IT. I WILL ATTEMPT A LONE KEDDAH." Gunga’s confidence contrasts with Babu’s worry, setting up a daring plan.
Gunga is seen instructing, "COME WE WILL UNHITCH TUSKER FROM THE CART. HE HAS HAD ENOUGH FOR TODAY.”, to which Rama replies, “SUCH IS SO, TOO MUCH WORK WILL MAKE HIM REBELLIOUS, BECAUSE HE IS SO YOUNG,"
Rama warns, "I HAVE THE KEDDAH ROPE, GUNGA, BUT YOU ARE FOOLISH TO TRY A LONE KEDDAH," while Gunga replies, "I AM NOT AFRAID! BUT IT IS TOO NEAR TO EVENING NOW. TOMORROW WE WILL TRY, NOW LET US GO TO THE GROVE OF BANANA TREES NEAR THE GAME TRAIL. SO THAT WE MAY EAT BEFORE WE SLEEP." Tusker’s form looms in the background, adding scale.
