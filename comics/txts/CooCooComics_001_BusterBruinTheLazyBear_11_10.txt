Realizing the boys are falling toward him, Buster Bruin shouts, “HEY! LOOK OUT!”
The boys fall onto their father. Jasper says “HERE WE ARE, POP - - -”, and Wilbur points out, “-LIKE YOU SAID!” Their additional weight is too much for the already strained root that Buster Bruin was holding on to. It snaps, and all three bears fall toward the ground below them.
Buster Bruin hits the snowy earth with a strong “POW!”, yet his sons’ falls are softened by his rotund stomach. They shout with excitement, “YIPPEE!” He groans, “UGH!”
Buster Bruin stands over the boys’ cot, holding one in either hand. Both hands wrapped in gauze and with three holes showing his body fur through his orange button-down pajamas, Buster Bruin tells Jasper and Wilbur “NOW REMEMBER NO MORE SHENANIGANS.. GO TO SLEEP!” Wilbur assents, “OKAY, POP!” Buster Bruin leers at Jasper sceptically.
Buster Bruin lays in his bed again and under the sheets says “LITTLE RASCALS - OH HUM!”
Buster Bruin snores in the background while the alarm clock labeled with the seasons is in the foreground on a table.
Jasper and Wilbur climb out of their cot, winking to one another and smiling mischievously.
