Narration says, “AND SO JAFARA AND KARIM CLIMBED QUICKLY TO THE ROOF AND SOON THEY CALLED UPON THE UNWILLING JINN THROUGH THE MAGIC LEATHERN CORD!” Karim stands in the center of the panel and holds an arm up to touch the smoke cloud in which Jinn appears, saying “OH JINN, I COMMAND YOU THROUGH THE POWER OF THE LEATHERN THONG TO TELL ME HOW TO SAVE THE FATHER OF MY BELOVED MYRRAH!” Jinn, now a round, pale face inside the pitch black smoke cloud, obeys Karim and explains, “TO BREAK THE SPELL YOU MUST GO TO THE LAKE OF LAVENDER… CATCH THERE AN ORANGE FISH, A SCARLET FISH, AND A GREEN FISH! COOK THEM IN CLARIFIED BUTTER, AND GIVE THEM TO THE CALIPH TO EAT!”
Next, narration says, “NOW HAVING THE SECRET, IT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT FOR KARIM TO TURN THE JINN INTO A GIANT BIRD, TO CARRY THEM TO THE LAVENDER LAKE!” Karim and Jafara ride a giant brown eagle over a bucolic lake.
A green panel of narration says, “THE GREAT BIRD SOARED MILES IN THE AIR, AND IN NO TIME THEY SWOOPED DOWN TO LAND ON THE SHORES OF THE LAVENDER LAKE…”
Jinn as the giant brown eagle curves his neck to look down on Jafara and Karim. Jafara says, “LET’S SEE.. A SCARLET FISH A GREEN FISH, AND AN ORANGE FISH!” Karim drags a net and looks over his shoulder at the lavender lake. He says, “I CAN SEE FROM HERE THAT THE LAKE IS SWARMING WITH THEM!”
An azure narration box says, “WITH THEIR PRECIOUS BURDEN OF STRANGE FISH FROM THE LAVENDER LAKE JAFARA AND KARIM REMOUNTED THE GIANT BIRD AND SAILED THROUGH THE SKIES WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT! BACK AT THE CALIPH’S PALACE MYRRAH HELPED THEM PREPARE THE WEIRD DINNER…”
