Spike panics, "O.K., O.K., JOHNNY! CAN DE CHATTER! SNAP ME UP! YEOOWW! SNORT!" as the dragon startles him waking up with a “SNORT” sound.
Spike and Johnny flee, with Spike exclaiming, "I—I JUST REMEMBERED! I GOT AN APPOINTMENT IN TOWN! S—SO LONG!" and Johnny agreeing, "YEAH, ME TOO!" as they abandon the scene pushing Gertie and Finny out of the way causing them to fall.
Finny is alarmed, exclaiming, "LOOK, GERTIE, THE DWAGON’S WAKIN’ AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE DWAGON’S WINNING!" as the dragon is seen chasing Spike and Johnny.
Gertie is seen crying, "OH, FINNY, I CAN’T LOOK! POOR BOYS—A TWO-COURSE DRAGON DINNER!" as Spike and Johnny as seen being crushed by the dragon’s jaws.
Finny exclaims, “LOOK, GERTIE, THE DWAGON SPIT ‘EM OUT!”
Gertie is then seen saying, “M-MAYBE HE DOESN’T EAT BETWEEN MEALS—I HOPE!” and Finny adding, "GEE, HE LOOKS MISEWABLE! I THINKS HE’S SICK!" as the dragon appears unwell.
Finny marvels, "GOLLY, THAT WAS A NARROW ESCAPE! WHAT HAPPENED?" and Spike casually explains, "ER—I—I JUST GRABBED HIM BY DE TONGUE…LOOKED HIM IN DE EYE AND TOLD HIM I’D PULL HIM INSIDE OUT IF HE DIDN’T LET US GO… NUTHIN’ TO IT — NUTHIN’ AT ALL!" as he hides a bottle of castor oil behind his back.
