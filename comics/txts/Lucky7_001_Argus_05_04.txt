Nick and Peter reach the old miser’s house and devise a plan. Nick says to Peter “AS SOON AS CARL LEAVES, I’LL GO IN AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND. YOU STAY HERE AND WHISTLE WHEN THE JANITOR COMES BACK”. Peter agrees and replies back “THE SECRET SIGNAL, NICK? O.K!”.
 And after Carl left, Nick breaks into the house as planned and says “SOMETHING PHONEY ABOUT THIS BIRD. LET’S SEE WHAT HIS GAME IS!”
 Going through the stuff in the house Nick thinks to himself, “I HOPE CARL STAYS AWAY LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO GO THROUGH THIS PLACE WITH A FINE TOOTH-COMB”.
 The narrator describes that just as Nick discovers evidence someone is seen entering the room, it's the janitor. Nick says to himself on discovering the evidence, “AHA I KNEW IT! HERE ARE THE 5 BANKBOOKS”
 And suddenly Carl, the janitor, bursts through the door and says “YOU SPOILED MY PLANS ONCE. I SHALL TAKE CARE YOU WON’T DO IT AGAIN!”
 Meanwhile, alarmed by Nick’s long absence Peter crosses over to the house on the roof and sees Nick and Carl in a fight and tells to himself, “OH, NICK’S IN TROUBLE! I BETTER GET HELP OR THE JANITOR WILL KILL HIM!”
