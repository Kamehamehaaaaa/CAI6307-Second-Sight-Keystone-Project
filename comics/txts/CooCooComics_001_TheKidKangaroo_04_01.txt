The Kangaroo Kid, a young kangaroo in blue pants, peers out of his sleeping mother’s pouch, saying, "HO-HUM—MOM’S ASLEEP! GUESS I’LL HOP OUT AND SEE WHAT’S COOKIN’…" as his mother, a larger kangaroo, snores with a "ZZZZZ" sound effect, her eyes closed. The pouch is checkered, adding a quirky detail. 
The Kangaroo Kid hopping away, declares, "AH! ALONE AT LAST! NOW FOR SOME ADVENTURE," with a mischievous grin, eager for excitement. 
the Kangaroo Kid is caught off guard mid-hop, when he sees a lion with a large black mane, and mutters, "HUH? DID I SAY ALONE?" The lion growling, confronts him, "HM…” with a sly expression.
