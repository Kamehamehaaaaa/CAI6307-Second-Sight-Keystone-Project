While Herbert is seen fitting the tube back into the tyre, the muscular man spots him from afar.
The scene intensifies with the man accusing, "WELL, YOU LITTLE RUNT—SO YOU’RE TH’ TIRE THIEF!!" while Herbert protests, "I—I DIDN’T STEAL IT, MISTER!"
Herbert, defends himself, "I JUST BORROWED IT—T’SAVE A WOMAN’S LIFE!!" as the muscular man in swim trunks skeptically retorts, “H—MMPH! A LIKELY STORY!" 
The man questioning, "SO YA BORROWED MY TIRE TO SAVE A WOMAN’S LIFE—HEY!!?" with Herbert nervously confirming, "Y—YES SIR!" 
The story climaxes with the man, furiously declaring, "WELL —NOW BORROW ANOTHER ONE T’SAVE YER OWN!!!" as he hurls Herbert into the sea.
