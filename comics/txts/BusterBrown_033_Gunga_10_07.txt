Rama, expresses concern, "I HOPE HE DOES NOT TAKE CHANCES, BABU," while Babu, reassures, "IF ANYONE CAN MAKE A LONE KEDDAH SUCCESSFULLY, MY FRIEND, IT IS GUNGA." The two mahouts watch from a safe distance, their anxious expressions contrasting with the lush jungle backdrop. The text, "GUNGA TRIES THE MOST DANGEROUS OF HUNTS… THE LONE KEDDAH!" sets the stage for Gunga’s daring mission.
Gunga, crawling through tall grass, as the text describes, "SILENTLY AND UNSEEN IN THE JUNGLE-BRED GUNGA CRAWLS THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS UNTIL HE IS UNDER A GREAT COW ELEPHANT… BUT SHE IS NOT PADMAH… HE MUST SEEK FURTHER." Gunga’s crouched form, barely visible beneath the massive elephant, emphasizes his stealth. The cow elephant’s legs tower above him, her presence imposing, while the jungle’s dense foliage adds to the sense of isolation.
The tnarration notes, "ONE WISE OLD BULL IS SUSPICIOUS, AND GUNGA ‘FREEZES’." A large bull elephant, with prominent tusks and a wary eye, sniffs the air, sensing something amiss. Gunga, hidden in the grass below, halts his movement, his body tense as he avoids detection. 
Gunga continues his crawl, navigating beneath the herd as he searches for Padmah. The perspective from below the elephants underscores the danger, with their massive legs and trunks looming overhead. The jungle’s tall grass and scattered trees frame the scene, emphasizing Gunga’s vulnerability amidst the herd.
