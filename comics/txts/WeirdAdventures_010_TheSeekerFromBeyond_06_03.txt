Narration introduces the woman back into the scene, “SUDDENLY… AN EERIE GLOW APPEARS BEFORE JOHN, AND THEN…” John gasps, “YOU!” The mystery woman appears in a yellow haze, grabbing her cape behind her and holding it outstretched to her right and left. She says, “I HAVE COME, BELOVED!”
Still laying in bed, John regards the woman and asks stutteringly, “WHO-WHO ARE YOU?” She introduces herself, “ZASA.. QUEEN OF THE PLANET XEDES! I HAVE SPANNED THE LIGHT YEARS.. TO CLAIM YOU!”
John is shocked and confused, asking “WHAT.. DO YOU WANT.. OF.. ME?” She sits in bed beside him, caresses his strong jawline and his thigh, and answers, “LOOK, JOHN GRANT, AND YOU SHALL SEE..”
Zada grabs John’s high cheekbones, and suddenly the vision she alluded too appears in a golden cloud behind her. In it Zada stands among guards and soldiers and vows, truculent, “SO MANDOR HAS RAISED AN ARMY AGAINST THE RULER OF XEDES! HE SHALL PAY FOR HIS TREACHERY… EVEN THO I LOVE HIM!”
In space, with several distant planets in the background, spaceships engage in a dogfight. On one side, red and yellow ships with short wingspans come downward. On the other white ships with longer wings soar upward. The nearest of the red and yellow ships shoots a beam at the nearest white one, and the latter explodes into a red flash and grey smoke going, “BA-ROOM” From within the red and yellow ship, “IT IS MANDOR’S SHIP, QUEEN” Zada replies, “MY TRAITOROUS LOVER.. DIES!”
Later, by a tall window adorned with blue drapes and a grey lattice. A bald man with a scabbard on his belt says faces Zada, as looks away from him, saying “VICTORY, MY QUEEN!” Zada is upset, “A HOLLOW VICTORY… MY BELOVED MANDOR IS DEAD!”
