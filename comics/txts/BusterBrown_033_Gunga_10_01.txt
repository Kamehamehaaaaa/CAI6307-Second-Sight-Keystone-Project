The cover page of Gunga introduces artwork showcasing a striking tropical setting, likely inspired by an Indian jungle or palace grounds, featuring a towering elephant, lush palm trees, and an ornate domed structure with red and orange accents in the background. 
At the center of the page stands a massive elephant, depicted in detailed grayscale shading that highlights its wrinkled skin. Perched atop the elephant is Gunga, the protagonist, a lean figure with a reddish-brown turban and minimal clothing—a loincloth—holding a spear over his shoulder. 
The background enhances the exotic atmosphere with tall palm trees swaying gently, their green fronds contrasting with the yellow sky. The domed structure, possibly part of a palace, features intricate designs and a golden spire. 
The text block at the bottom, provides narrative context: "GUNGA, WHO WAS MAHOUT, THAT IS, A DRIVER AND TRAINER OF ELEPHANTS TO THE MAHARAJA OF BAKORE, FINISHES HIS TASK AND TAKES HIS ELEPHANT, TEELA, BACK FOR A WELL NEEDED REST, UNAWARE THAT A DANGEROUS ADVENTURE, A ‘LONE KEDDAH’ AWAITED HIM." This foreshadowing builds anticipation, suggesting Gunga’s journey will soon turn perilous.
