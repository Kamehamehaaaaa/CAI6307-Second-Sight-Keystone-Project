Smilin' Ed, the stout leader in his red and black climbing outfit with a green hat, is preparing to ski. Froggy the Gremlin, in his red polka-dotted outfit, stands nearby with Squeaky the Mouse, in his yellow and black striped shirt, both encouraging Smilin' Ed with a speech bubble that says, "SMILIN’ ED, SO I’LL JUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE SHOVE!" Midnight the Cat, with her red bow tie, adds a simple, "NICE!" as she watches. The man in gray climbing gear, known as Mr. Traveller, stands behind Smilin' Ed, giving him a gentle push, saying, "COME… SMILIN’ ED, LET YOURSCHELF GO!" Smilin' Ed, on skis with poles in hand, starts to slide down the slope, his scarf trailing behind him as he begins his descent against a backdrop of jagged mountain peaks and pine trees.
The descent quickly turns chaotic as Smilin' Ed picks up speed, his expression shifting to one of panic as he shouts, "HALP!" He careens down the slope, his body leaning forward uncontrollably, skis wobbling as he speeds past trees. The momentum sends him crashing into a tree, his skis and poles flying in different directions with a burst of stars and motion lines indicating the impact. The collision leaves Smilin' Ed tangled in the branches, his scarf wrapped around the tree, and his body in an awkward, upside-down position.
At the bottom of the slope, the rest of the gang watches the spectacle with a mix of concern and amusement. Smilin' Ed, still hanging from the tree, mutters, "MY GOOTNESS, I DON’T KNOW VETHER I LIKE SMILIN’ ED’S NEW SHAPE OR NOT!" Froggy, grinning as always, responds with, "I THINK SMILIN’ ED LIKES VINTER SPORTS, I DO!" The group’s laughter is interrupted by the arrival of an ambulance, a red vintage vehicle with a star on the side, driven by a man in a white uniform. The ambulance crew rushes to Smilin' Ed’s aid, carrying a stretcher as Smilin' Ed, now freed from the tree, lies on the ground, dazed but still smiling, exclaiming, "OH-H-H-H-H-H-H-H!" The scene captures the group’s characteristic humor, turning a skiing disaster into a moment of shared hilarity.
