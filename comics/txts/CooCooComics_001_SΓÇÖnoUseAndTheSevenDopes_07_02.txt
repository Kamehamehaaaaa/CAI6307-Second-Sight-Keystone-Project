The queen approaches a huntsman who wears a feathered cap and a tunic and carries a long knife in a scabbard. She asks him, “I WANT YOU TO TAKE S’NO USE FOR A NICE LONG WALK - AND SHE’S NOT TO RETURN … UNDERSTAND?” The huntsman listens with a hand held up to his ear.
Holding his knife in one hand, the huntsman leads S’no Use saying “COME ON, S’NO USE. PUT ON YOUR FEET! WE’RE GOING FOR A WALK IN THE COUNTRY.” S’no Use is delighted, “OH! GOODY! MAYBE I’LL MEET A PRINCE CHARMING OR SOMETHING.”
A ribbon narrates, “AFTER A BRISK WALK OF A FEW HUNDRED MILES…” S’no Use doubles over with her hand behind her back and sniffs a flower on the edge of a long cliff. Behind her, the huntsman remarks, “HERE’S MY CHANCE!” and swings his leg up.
Still behind S’no Use, the huntsman is racked with guilt and cries, saying “IT’S NO USE i CAN’T DO IT.” His leg is still lifted as if to kick her.
The huntsman turns from S’no Use and runs away from the cliff and into the woods behind S’no Use saying “I’LL SNEAK AWAY… MAYBE SHE’LL GET LOST OF FALL OFF THE CLIFF OR BE EATEN BY A BEAR OR GET STRUCK BY LIGHTNING … OR SOMETHING!” S’no Use continues to sniff the flower on the edge of the cliff.
Narration says, “IN A FEW DAYS S’NO USE DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS LOST.” S’no Use puts a hand to her forehead and cries, “HALP! I’M LOST.” Wooden signs surround her pointing to various destinations and in every direction. One says, “ONE WAY TO LAS ANGELES,” pointing right. Pointing left, another says “PARDON.. THIS WAY” Another points down saying “TO CINEMA COMICS” Three more say “THIS WAY TO BUENOS AIRES”, pointing left; “TO POLO GROUNDS”, pointing left and right; and “RAIN TOMORROW END RIDERS.”, pointing right. A final sign advertises, “BUY U.S. DEFENSE BONDS.”
