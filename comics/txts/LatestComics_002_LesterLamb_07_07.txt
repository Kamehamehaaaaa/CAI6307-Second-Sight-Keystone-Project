The story begins outside Teddy’s Dress Shop, where Mary, with her blonde curls and red bow, scolds Lester in frustration, "OF ALL THE HORRID STUNTS! WE’LL DO VERY WELL WITHOUT THAT BEAST THAT FOLLOWS YOU!" as she tries to distance herself from his antics. Later, the scene shifts to a bustling grocery store where Mary, ever practical, requests, "GIVE ME A POUND OF BUTTER, A LOAF OF BREAD, AND A CAN OF VEGETABLE SOUP!" from the shopkeeper, a kindly older man behind the counter.
The shopkeeper, scratching his head, muses, "LET’S SEE, NOW WHERE DO WE KEEP THE CANNED SOUP?" unaware that Lester has sneaked behind the counter. With a gleam in his eye, Lester spots the stack of cans and exclaims, "HERE THEY ARE!" but the shopkeeper’s warning comes too late, "NO! NO! DON’T TAKE THE BOTTOM ONE!" In an instant, Lester’s tug triggers a spectacular "CRASH!" as the entire pile of cans topples, flying everywhere while Lester scrambles to escape the chaos. The shopkeeper, exasperated, throws up his hands in dismay.
The tale concludes with Mary and Lester racing away from the scene, Mary muttering, "AND SO, NOW EVERYWHERE THAT MARY STRAYS, THE LAMB, YOU GUESSED, HE STAYS!" as they hurry down a path. Lester, now tied to a tree with a leash, looks sheepish yet determined, tugging to break free, proving once again that no matter where Mary goes, her mischievous lamb is bound to follow with trouble close behind!
