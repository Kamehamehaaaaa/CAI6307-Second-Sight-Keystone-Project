Narration says, “AND SO, EQUIPPED FOR A SALVAGE JOB, THE ‘SEA HAWK’ PUTS OUT TO SEA, AND HEADS STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW FOR BANDARA ISLAND!” The Sea Hawk glides across the ocean waters near a green island with sails unfurled and at full mast.
More narration between panels says, “ONCE IN THE COVE AT BANDARA ISLAND, THE SUNKEN ‘ISLAND QUEEN’ WAS EAILY LOCATED… THEY ANCHORED NEARBY, BUT BEFORE THEY COULD BEGIN SALVAGE OPERATIONS…”
In a circular panel, Kala puts his right hand over his forehand to block the light out of his eyes and points to shore with the other, sounding off “LOOK! NATIVES!” Chad grips the spokes of the ship’s wheel tightly and steers toward Bandara Island.
Near the island, two polynesian men approach the Sea Hawk in a canoe. One of them stands and orders Chad to stay away, “GO AWAY! ISLAND TABOO FOR WHITE MEN!” Chad questions, leaning over the Sea Hawk’s port side “TABOO? FOR WHITE MEN? WHY?”
The men in the canoe come closer, and the one who spoke before explains, “WHITE MEN COME BEFORE! NOW MY SON.. HIM SICK-TO-DIE!” Chad lifts a hand to point back over the Sea Hawk’s deck and tells Kala, “I GET IT! HIS SON GOT SICK WHILE THE WHITE MEN WERE HERE, AND HE THINKS IT’S THEIR FAULT! KALA… GET THE MEDICINE KIT! WE’RE GOING ASHORE…” Kala listens with his arms folded on the port-side railing.
