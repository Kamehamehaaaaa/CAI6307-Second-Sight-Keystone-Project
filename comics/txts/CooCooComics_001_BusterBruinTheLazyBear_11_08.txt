Buster Bruin stops on the edge of a cliff, for he recognizes the sound of one of the boys calling, “YOO-HOO, POP!”
He looks up at Jasper and Wilbur from the bottom of the cliff and remarks, “OH MY GOODNESS - - - THEY CLIMBED THE CLIFF!”
Buster Bruin climbs a slender tree trunk and says to himself, “I HOPE THIS W-WORKS!”
He has reached the top of the slender tree he climbed, and it has bowed over to the clifftop the boys are on. Buster Bruin almost touches down to reunite with his children, but he doesn’t see a goat behind him who thinks, “HMMMM! TRESPASSER!”
Sitting on the cliff’s edge, Buster Bruin sighs, “WHEW!”, in exhaustion. Meanwhile, the goat charges unseen behind him.
The goat headbutts Buster Bruin in the rear where he sits with a strong “WHUMP”, crying “GARR-RGH” Buster Bruin is knocked off the edge of the cliff screaming, “EEE-YOW!”
