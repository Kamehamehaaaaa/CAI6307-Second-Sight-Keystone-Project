The sergeant struggles at an anti-aircraft gun, his face contorted in frustration as he exclaims, "!! SO! FINE THING! ENEMY PLANES COMING AND I CAN’T OPERATE THIS THING!" while fumbling with the controls, stars and motion lines around him emphasizing his confusion. The gun, mounted on a circular platform with shells nearby, suddenly malfunctions and spins rapidly, its barrels whirling out of control as the sergeant clings on, a large "!!!" above him signaling the escalating chaos amidst a backdrop of trees and military equipment.
Lulu, standing nearby in her red dress, looks exasperated and says, "WHAT A BREAK! WITH A A.A. GUN, I CAN OPERATE THE REMOTE CONTROL SYSTEM AND KNOCK THOSE PLANES DOWN!" as she dashes toward a control box, her purse swinging as she takes charge with determination. She examines the control panel, which has switches labeled "RANGE," "GUN NO. 1," and "FLIGHT," muttering, "I SAW PICTURES OF THIS MAGIC BRAIN DEVICE, NOW WHERE IS THAT FIRING BUTTON?" her brow furrowed as she searches for the right switch, unaware of the danger she’s about to unleash.
Meanwhile, Pvt. Pinto, watching from a distance, spots the approaching planes in the sky and realizes they’re not the enemy’s, shouting, "GULP! OUR PLANES AND SHE’S GONNA FIRE GUN! LULU!" his voice filled with panic as he rushes toward her, his arms outstretched. The planes, marked as friendly, fly closer, while explosions labeled "HALP!" burst in the background, adding to the tension. The comic builds comedic suspense as Lulu’s well-meaning attempt to operate the advanced weaponry spirals into a potential disaster, blending wartime action with humorous misunderstanding.
