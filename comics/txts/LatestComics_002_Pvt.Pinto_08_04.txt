Private Pinto stands at the entrance of a camp, his face lighting up as he greets a woman named Lulu, saying, "GEE, I’M GLAD TO SEE YOU, LULU!" with a warm smile. Lulu, dressed in a red outfit and hat, waves back cheerfully, responding, "HI YA," her blonde hair swaying as she stands near a tent with a sign reading "PRIVATE PINTO." The scene shifts as a stern sergeant looms over Pvt. Pinto, scolding him with, "Y’YES, SARGE? YOUR BARRACKS DON’T PASS INSPECTION, GO BACK AND HIT THAT DUST!" causing Pinto to slump in defeat, his shoulders drooping as the sergeant points authoritatively.
The sergeant, now alone with a sly grin, mutters to himself, "NOW THAT WAS SMART STRATEGY WITH THAT PUNK OUT OF THE WAY I’LL HAVE THE LADY TO MYSELF!" his hands on his hips, plotting his next move with confidence. He approaches Lulu, saying, "MISS LULU, I PRESUME?" as he eyes her approvingly, while Lulu, looking around, asks, "YES… WHERE DID PRIVATE JOE GO?" her tone curious yet calm. The sergeant, seizing the opportunity, offers, "THE PRIVATE WILL BE ENGAGED IN IMPORTANT MILITARY MATTERS, MAY I ESCORT YOU ABOUT THE POST INSTEAD?" to which Lulu replies with a smile, "WHAT KIND OF SERGEANT, I’D BE DEE-LIGHTED!" her hands clasped in agreement as they stand near a tent.
The sergeant beams with pride, boasting, "THERE’S YOUNG LADY IS THE GREATEST FLAY, ETC.!" his arms raised in triumph, while Lulu walks beside him, thinking to herself, "THIS SERGEANT’S EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT GOOPY PRIVATE—MY PLANS SHOULD GO WELL!" her expression sly as she adjusts her purse, clearly enjoying the shift in attention. The camp fades into the background as they stroll off together, leaving Pvt. Pinto behind, reinforcing the sergeant’s cunning victory in this comedic rivalry over Lulu’s company.
