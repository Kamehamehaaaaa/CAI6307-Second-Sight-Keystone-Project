Babu commands Padmah, "BACK, PADMAH! NOW YOU LEARN YOUR LESSON. BACK. I SAY!” His authoritative stance and raised arm, pointing toward Padmah, contrast with the elephant’s towering form in the background. 
Babu drives Padmah back, as the narration notes, “AS BABU DRIVES PADMAH BACK, GUNGA AND RAMA DRAW IN THE SNUBBING ROPE TO HOLD HER FAST." Padmah’s massive form struggles, her trunk raised, adding drama to the capture.
Babu acknowledges, "YOU WERE RIGHT, GUNGA. WE HAVE CAPTURED HER. NOW WHAT WILL I DO?" while Gunga advises, "THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO DO. FORCE HER TO KNEEL, MOUNT, AND RIDE HER BACK. WE WILL FOLLOW WITH THE ROPE AND SHOULD SHE GIVE TROUBLE WE WILL QUICKLY SNUB HER TO A TREE." and Rama adds, “WE WILL BE READY, BABU. DO NOT FEAR.” while Gunga and Rama, pull a thick rope, their strained expressions and the rope’s tension highlighting their effort. Their calm stances and the rope in hand suggest readiness, with Padmah’s subdued form and the surrounding trees reinforcing the controlled environment.
Gunga is seen organizing, "I AM HERE. WE ARE READY TO GO.” and Rama adds, “LET US PILE THE EXTRA ROPE IN THE CART. HOW DOES PADMAH BEHAVE, BABU?” while Babu observes, "I THINK THIS TIME SHE HAS LEARNED HER LESSON WELL. SHE IS QUIET." The mahouts handle the rope near a cart, Padmah standing calmly, her trunk lowered, indicating submission. The jungle’s vibrant hues and scattered plants add depth.
The scene concludes with the narration, "AND SO THE BAD ELEPHANT, PADMAH, LEARNS HER LESSON," showing Padmah walking with Babu atop, her behavior tamed.
