4 men in cowboy attire sitting in front of the fireplace. The guy in the red shirt begins narrating a story and says “THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A DOCTOR AND A MODEL PLANE. I KNEW THE DOC PRETTY WELL… WE’D BEEN AFTER GOLD TOGETHER, UP IN ALASKA. ANYHOW, IT WAS A NASTY NIGHT IN THE PALE ALTO RIVER VALLEY ….”
In the next panel the story begins with its setup as a stormy night with heavy rains and lightning as suggested by the red shirt guy. Two men are driving through the storm in a red car. One of them is Doctor and the other looks like a young boy who is trying to get a serum to a smoother place. The young boy says “GEE DOC, THIS IS A TERRIBLE STORM! THINK WE’LL GET THE SERUM THROUGH ?” To which the Doctor replies “IF THIS CAR HOLDS OUT, AND… O.OH! WHAT’S THE RADIO SAYING?”.
The radio in the car announces “THE ADAMS RIVER BRIDGE WASHED OUT MINUTES AGO…”.
It looks like the bridge was pivotal to the transportation of the serum. “WE HAVE TO GET THE SERUM TO DOCTOR BRANCH IN THE NEXT TOWN.” Says the doctor with determination. To which the young boy pointing towards the shore replies “YES, DOC THE BRIDGE IS GONE… WE CAN’T GO ANY FURTHER. LOOK! SOMEBODY’S ON THE OTHER SHORE.”
They reach the broken bridge, and the boy flashes his torch lights into the river and says “THEY SAY THE RIVER’S SWOLLEN, DOC. CAN’T EVEN SWIM ACROSS!”. 
A man with a bow in hand enters the scene and he seems to know the young boy and calls him by his name and suggests “HELLO, WILL! I CAN GET A MESSAGE ACROSS WITH AN ARROW!’. Will, the young boy, says to the doctor “HE’S THE ARCHERY CHAMP MAYBE HE CAN SHOOT THAT SERUM OVER THE RIVER.”
