The top left panel captures a sergeant clinging to a malfunctioning anti-aircraft gun, his body spinning uncontrollably amidst a whirlwind of motion lines and stars, as he yells, "HEY! GET ME OFF THIS MERRY-GO-ROUND!" The gun is mounted on a circular platform with shells scattered around, set against a grassy field with trees and military equipment in the distance. The top right panel shows Pvt. Pinto sprinting toward the chaotic scene, his arms raised in urgency, replying, "IF SHE FIRES YOU’LL BE ENOUGH!" as he tries to prevent a disaster, the spinning gun still visible in the background as the landscape stretches with hills and a clear sky.
The middle left panel depicts Pvt. Pinto arriving at a control area, his figure mid-stride with a desperate expression, reaching out toward Lulu and shouting, "LULU! DON’T PLAY WITH THAT… STOP!!!" as he sees her near a control box with switches and papers, the camp’s tents and scattered documents framing the tense moment. The middle right panel focuses on Lulu, her blonde hair and red dress striking as she leans over the control panel, her hand poised over the switches, saying, "THIS ISN’T PLAY! SABOTAGE IS MY BUSINESS! NOW WHERE IS THAT FIRING BUTTON…?" her face determined, with a window and papers in the background hinting at her focused intent, unaware of the danger.
In the bottom left panel, the sergeant dangles precariously from the cannon’s barrel, his legs hanging as the gun has finally stopped spinning, exclaiming, "I’M GLAD THIS THING STOPPED… WOE IS ME?" with sweat drops around him showing his exhaustion, sandbags below and a backdrop of tents and trees marking the military setting. The bottom right panel zooms in dramatically on Lulu’s hand, her fingers inches from pressing a large, round button labeled on the control panel, building suspense as the panel’s border tightens around her hand, leaving the outcome uncertain.
