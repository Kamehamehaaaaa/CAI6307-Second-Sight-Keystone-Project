The scene opens with Mervin, the dapper lion magician, standing on a stage framed by red curtains. Dressed in his iconic red wizard hat adorned with stars and a crescent moon, a blue vest, and a black bow tie, he twirls his cane with a confident grin, addressing the audience with a hint of disappointment, saying, "TOO BAD WE CAN’T GIVE SOME OF OUR ALLIES… WELL FOLKS, LET’S GET ON WITH THE SHOW!" A red table with a star and crescent moon decoration stands beside him, setting the stage for his next trick.
In the next panel, Mervin gestures toward a lovely young girl with blonde hair, dressed in a red outfit, perched atop the decorated table. He declares, "I’LL NOW PERFORM A FEAT OF MAGIC WHICH I LEARNED ON MY TRIP TO INDIA!" The audience, a mix of animals including pigs and monkeys, watches from below, their faces filled with anticipation. Mervin then turns to the girl, announcing, "I’M GOING TO MAKE THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL VANISH!" as he prepares for the trick.
The scene builds with drama as Mervin, holding a red cape with stars, calls out, "I WAVE MY MAGIC CAPE IN FRONT AND WATCH—!" The audience gasps in unison, whispering, "HOW WONDERFUL! TERRIFIC! HE CAN’T DO THAT!" their voices a mix of awe and skepticism, their silhouettes casting a shadowy backdrop. With a mighty flourish, Mervin sweeps his cape and shouts, "CIGAMO!!" and—poof!—the girl disappears in a swirl of motion, leaving only the cape in Mervin’s hands as he struggles to control its momentum, his hat slightly askew from the effort.
The final panel shows Mervin standing triumphant, holding the cape with a proud smile, while the audience buzzes with excitement, whispering, "SHE HAS DISAPPEARED! THE GODS OF INDIA HAVE TAKEN HER AWAY… BUT SHE’LL BE BACK, WE HAVE ANOTHER SHOW TO-NIGHT!" The stage remains vibrant with its red curtains and magical props, as Mervin prepares for the next act in this magical spectacle, blending humor and wonder in a playful display of stage magic.
