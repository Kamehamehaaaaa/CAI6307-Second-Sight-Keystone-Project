A yellow narration ribbon proclaims, “ALL THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS SORDID STORY ARE SUPERFLUOUS AND ENTIRELY MALICIOUS!” A second green ribbon begins the story, “LONG, LONG, LONG, LONG, LONG, LONG AGO - - NOW GO ON WITH THE STORY…”
A queen with a small crown perched upon her glossy black hair, which has been fashioned into a bun behind her head, holds a smiling mirror and asks it, “MIRROR, MIRROR IN MY HAND-WHO’S THE FAIREST IN THE LAND?” It replies, “AH! SO YOU’RE WONDERING THAT TOO!”
Still smiling, the mirror answers, “YOUR STEP-DAUGHTER S’NO USE, IS REALLY SOME KID. SHE’S PRETTY LIKE ANYTHING!” The queen scowls, “WHAT!”
Shaking her fist through a circular panel highlighting only her, she vows “I’LL GET RID OF THAT BRAT! NO KID’S GONNA MAKE A MONKEY OUT OF ME!”
