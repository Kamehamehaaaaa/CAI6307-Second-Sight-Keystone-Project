A soldier in uniform, his face etched with shock, cradles his helmet as he cries out, "THEY GOT HIM! THEY KILLED JOE!" against a backdrop of smoke and tanks.  Another soldier is seen crouched behind a fallen log, staring at advancing enemy tanks in the distance, as he says, “THOSE TANKS’LL CUT THE COMPANY TO PIECES! BUT HOW CAN I WARN THEM? IT’S SUICIDE TO TRY TO CUT THROUGH THAT RED FLANK!"  Pete, his eyes wide with fear, says, "I DON’T WANNA DIE… I GOT A WIFE… A KID TO GO BACK TO! I COULD FALL BACK TO CAMP NOW AND LIVE! I DON’T WANNA BE A HERO!"  Pete’s internal struggle is depicted through a thought bubble where he recalls his earlier vow: "JOE, I’M GOIN’ TO SEND THAT KID SOMETHIN’ HE CAN REALLY BE PROUD OF FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. I’M GOIN’ OUT AND WIN A MEDAL FOR WILLIE!" He says, “I DON’T WANT IT! I DON’T WANT A MEDAL”.
The soldier sees a haunting vision of his son Willie, crying, "I DON’T WANT IT! I DON’T WANT A MEDAL!" as his mother Mary, tears streaming down her face, sobs, "WILLIE, TRY AND UNDERSTAND, DARLING… DADDY WON’T BE COMING HOME ANY MORE… (SOB) I WANT MY DADDY… (SOB) I WANT MY DADDY…" Pete, snapping back to reality, resolves, "WILLIE! WILLIE! I’LL COME HOME… I’LL COME HOME!" 
Pete imagines a grim scene featuring a medical tent, marked with a red cross, where a soldier reports to a medic, "YOU’LL HAVE TO MAKE FIVE MORE TRIPS TO BRING THE DEAD IN A WHOLE COMPANY WIPED OUT… THE TANKS CAUGHT THEM BY SURPRISE! NEVER HAD A CHANCE…"
Pete recalls Joe’s warning, "IF THOSE TANKS SPOT YOU, YOU’RE A GONER! HEAD BACK FOR CAMP, PETE…" and, with a steely resolve, declares, "JOE… POOR JOE! I CAN’T LET YOU DOWN, TOO! NO! WILLIE WON’T HAVE HIS DADDY… OR A MEDAL… BUT THOSE GUYS IN BAKER COMPANY WILL HAVE THEIR CHANCE!"
