The scene is set outside a charming alpine village with red-roofed buildings and snow-covered mountains in the background. A yellow bus with a green stripe, labeled "Charter," is parked on the right side of the panel. The characters are stepping off the bus, bundled up for the cold. Smilin' Ed, the stout man with a mustache, is wearing a brown coat with black stripes and a blue cap, holding a small suitcase. He says, "YOU ZEE, SMILIN' EDZ! DIS IS ZUN VALLEY!" Froggy the Gremlin, the large frog in a red outfit with polka dots, is standing on the bus steps, holding a small mouse in a yellow and black striped shirt. Froggy says, "I'M GOING TO MAKE A FAT SNOW MAN LIKE SMILIN' ED, I AM, I AM!" Another character, a man in a fur coat and hat, steps off the bus behind them, holding a suitcase. He says, "MY GOODNESS! COLD, ISN'T IT."
The setting shifts back to the cozy room from the previous comic, with a roaring fireplace in the background emitting orange flames. Smilin' Ed is sitting on a red rug, surrounded by climbing gear like ropes and ice picks. Heâ€™s holding an ice pick in his right hand, looking excited, says, "JA, SMILIN' ED, VE VILL SCHTART THE VACATION TOMORROW BY CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN!" Standing next to him is the man in the blue suit with a red tie, smiling confidently, says, "WILL WE? MY GOODNESS. I'D JUST AS SOON CLIMB RIGHT BACK INTO THIS CHAIR!" Squeaky the Mouse, in his yellow and black striped shirt, is peeking out from behind the gear, looking curious.
Early next morning, Smilin' Ed is on the left, dressed in a red and black outfit with knee-high socks, holding a coiled rope over his shoulder and an ice pick in his hand. He looks enthusiastic, "COME! ONVARD! DOTS DER SCHTUFF, VE CLIMB A MOUNTAIN!" Next to him is the man in the blue suit, now dressed in a gray climbing outfit with a scarf, looking a bit nervous. Midnight the Cat, the black cat with a red bow tie, is also present, dressed in a small climbing outfit.
The background shows a steep, snow-covered slope with jagged peaks under a blue sky with wispy clouds. The characters are roped together, climbing upward. Smilin' Ed leads the way, followed by the man in the gray outfit, Froggy, Midnight, and Squeaky, all in their climbing gear. Froggy is chanting, "E-I-E-I-E-I-E-E-E! FI-FI-FI-FI-FI-FI... GOOD!" A text box at the top of the panel reads, "AND SO SMILIN' ED AND HIS GANG GO MOUNTAIN CLIMBING..."
