Another narration box, “IT WAS WHILE DRIVING HOM THAT THE WORD TOMORROW BEGAN TO RUN THROUGH MY MIND IN A WEIRD SORT OF WAY. AND SUDDENLY I WAS AFRAID! WHAT IF TOMORROW NEVER CAME… FOR ME?”
Paul drives his yellow car through the city streets but decides, “I’D BETTER PULL UP TO THE CURB AND GET HOLD OF MYSELF…”
With a cloud of dust trailing behind it, Paul’s car speeds backwards into the path of an oncoming trolley car. From within, he shouts, “I MUST HAVE SHIFTED WRONG! I’M MOVING BACKWARDS!”
Narration hangs over an image of Paul in a cold sweat. It says, “BUT I HAD MADE NO MISTAKE IN HANDLING THE CAR! FOR SOME STRANGE REASON, IT WAS MOVING BACKWARD AND I HAD NO CONTROL OVER IT!” He trembles, “WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IN HEAVEN’S NAME IS HAPPENING TO ME?”
With most of the sidewalk obscured to focus on Paul and the doorman from before, Paul returns to the apartment he had just left. Paul says, “I’M BACK AGAIN, MIKE. BUT I DON’T KNOW HOW I GOT HERE OR WHY… I’M IN SOME…” Mike, the doorman, speaks incoherently, “SNOITALUTARGNOC, RIS. TUB WORROMOT SI A GNOL SYAW FFO. AH! AH! UOY NAC LLITS EGNAHC ROUY DNIM.”
Paul addresses Mike sternly, “WHAT KIND OF DOUBLE-TALK IS THAT, MIKE? IT’S NO TIME FOR A JOKE…” Mike just brings a hand up to his chin and smiles.
Paul goes inside and thinks to himself, “MIKE WASN’T TALKING GIBBERIS! HE WAS TALKING BACKWARDS! AND I… I’M MOVING BACKWARDS! LIVING BACKWARDS!” David turns his head over his shoulder as Paul walks backwards into his apartment.
