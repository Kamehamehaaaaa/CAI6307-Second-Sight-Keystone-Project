Narration says, “MOMENTS LATER.” Joe rubs his head on the floor and says, “THAT LOUSY ‘SWEDE’ I’LL FILL HIM SO FULL OF HOLES- -” The other man does likewise, saying “NEVER MIND THAT! ANNA’S GONE OFF TO TURN OFF THE MACHINE… WE GOT TO STOP HER! THIS BIG APE IS DEAD ANYWAY!”
More narration continues, “BUT OE IS WRONG! THERE IS A SPARK OF STRENGTH LEFT IN SWEDE’S GREAT BODY-”
Joe and his accomplice leave the room through the open doorway behind the shattered door, Swede grips the nightstand as though he is getting up. Joe does not notice him and vows, “THAT DAME… I’LL KILL HER! MY OWN SISTER CROSSING ME…”
“POLICE? GO TO THE ROOF OF… ARROW BUILDING! MACHINE THAT CONTROLS THE DOME IS THERE! HURRY! IT’S TRUE - I TELL YOU! YOU’VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME! YOU’VE GOT TO BELIEVE N- -” Swede uses the last of his strength to call the police and collapses to the floor, dropping the mouthpiece, mid sentence.
Narration says, “AND MEANWHILE.” Anna is attending to the machine on the edge of the Arrow Building’s rooftop. In the background, a shorter blue building with a watertower on top burns with flames and smoke billowing out of the windows. She says, “THERE! NOW TURN THIS DIAL, AND THEN JUST ONE MORE MOVE - -” From the right, Joe’s accomplice spots Anna, “THERE SHE IS, JOE!”
Joe holds up his pistol to threaten Anna’s life. He orders, “GIVE US THAT RING, ANNA!” Anna exclaims, giving in to him, “JOE -!? ALL RIGHT, JOE… HERE!” Anna throws the ring to the ground at their feet, and Joe’s accomplice kneels down by the door to the roof to pick it up, saying “AHA!”
Anna turns back and does one final step to turn off the machine. She sounds off, “THERE! IT’S OFF! IT’S OHHHHHH!” She is shot by Joe, who shouts in anger, “SHE’S TRICKED US, YOU DOPE! SHE’S TURNED OFF THE MACHINE! GET HER!”
