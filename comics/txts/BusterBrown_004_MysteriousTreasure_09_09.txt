Kala stands below the deck of the Island Queen with Chad and the Chief, and he says, “HUH! ME NOT FIND NO TREASURE! THINK OLD CAPTAIN PLENTY NUTS!” Chad stands with the chief on the other side of the panel. The Chief tells him, “ME SMELL SOMETHING! SOMETIME AGO ME SMELL SAME THING! ME TRY REMEMBER NOW!”
The Chief remembers, “NOW ME ‘MEMBER! LONG TIME GO, ME GO LONG WHALE SHIP… CATCH SICK SPERM WHALE! HIM HAVE SMELL LIKE THIS NOW!” Chad questions his recollection, “ARE YOU SURE, CHIEF? MAN ALIVE! I KNOW WHAT THE TREASURE IS…”
In a circular panel Kala and Chad pry open the floorboards beneath them, and Chad tells the islanders, “QUICK, EVERYBODY! SNIFF AROUND THE CABIN AND FIND WHERE THE SMELL IS THE STRONGEST.. WAIT.. i THINK WE’VE FOUND IT!
Light from above shines on the treasure that Chad and Kala uncovered beneath the floorboards. Chad lies on the floor above and points down on it saying, “THERE’S YOUR TREASURE, KALA! THAT’S AMBERGRIS! IT’S WORTH A BIG FORTUNE!” A red narration box explains, “AMBERGRIS! THE STRANGE SUBSTANCE GIVE OFF BY A SICK SPERM WHALE, AND PRICELESS TO MAKERS OF FINE PERFUME! AS IT’S VERY SELDOM FOUND, THE MASS WHICH KALA AND CHAD NOW OWN IS WORTH A FORTUNE!”
Wearing Beau Dillion’s hat and a blue tie, Kala holds up a silver spoon and sits beside Chad who reclines on a wicker couch and smokes one of Dillion’s thin, white cigars; and smoke rings rise from him. Kala laughs, “HAH! ME LIKE THIS BE RICH BUSINESS! WHEN WE POOR AGAIN YOU ME GO HUNT MORE AMBLER GREASE, HUH CHAD?”
