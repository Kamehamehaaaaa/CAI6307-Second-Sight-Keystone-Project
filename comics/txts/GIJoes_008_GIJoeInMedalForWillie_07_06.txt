Pete desperately holds his ground against advancing tanks, clutching his last grenade as he cries, "I GOT ONE GRENADE LEFT… MAYBE I CAN… OHMMMM! MY LEGS!" The tank’s gunfire erupts with a "RATTATTATTATTA", and Pete’s body recoils in pain as bullets tear through his legs. 
Pete lying down on the floor with his hand up in the air looks at an approaching tank “ RUMMMMBBLE”.
Artillery fire explodes, marked by a fiery "WHEEEEE BLAAAM! BLAAAM!", as shells rain down, obliterating the enemy tanks in a blaze of orange and red against a smoky sky. 
A narration reveals the tide turning: "AND AS THE ARTILLERY BLASTED THE RED FLANK ATTACK TO BITS, THE GI’S ON THE SKIRMISH LINE SWEPT FORWARD AND MOP UP THE DISHEARTENED RED TROOPS… LATER…" The scene shifts to a calmer moment, where a captain with a crisp uniform, commends Joe, saying, "JOE, THAT WAS A FINE PIECE OF WORK YOU DID. I’M PUTTING YOU IN FOR THE BRONZE STAR!" Joe, his face lighting up with a grateful smile, replies, "GOSH! I…GEE, THANKS, CAPTAIN! I WANNA SAY GOOD-BYE," as soldiers move in the background, some carrying rifles, others tending to the wounded. 
A soldier informs Joe of Pete’s fate near a tent with a red cross: "HEY, JOE, YOUR PAL, PETE CIRILLO IS IN A PRETTY BAD WAY. HIS LEGS! THEY’RE SENDIN’ HIM BACK TO A BASE HOSPITAL! HE’S IN THERE IF YOU…" Joe, reflecting, responds, "GOOD! I SENT HIM BACK TO CAMP WHEN THE TANKS WERE SPOTTED!" 
Pete’s bravery is revealed as the soldier explains, "YEAH? WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN’T GO! SCOUTS FOUND HIM OUT THERE WITH THOSE RED TANKS! HE’D KNOCKED OUT TWO OF THEM WITH GRENADES BEFORE THEY GOT HIM!” To which Joe replies, “THEN… THEN HE HELD THEM OFF—THINKIN’ I DIDN’T GET THROUGH! I WONDERED WHAT HELD THEM TANKS OFF SO LONG!"
