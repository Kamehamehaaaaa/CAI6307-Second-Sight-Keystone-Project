Two men dressed up as cowboys named Bobby and Windy are in a model plane shop. Looking outside the window of the shop Bobby says “LOOK AT THAT HEAVY FOG OUT THERE, WINDY — WHAT A MISERABLE DAY!”. To which Windy responds “WHO SAYS IT’S MISERABLE? I LIKE DAYS LIKE THIS, BOBBY!” And the store person who seems to know Windy replies “YOU WOULD, WINDY!”. 
Windy explains his stance of why it's not a miserable day by commenting “NO DAY IS MISERABLE WHEN YOU HAVE A HOBBY TO WORK ON.” And Bobby comes up with the suggestion “SINCE WE CAN’T GO RIDING, WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE FUN INSIDE, WINDY.”
Looking at one of the model planes Windy, in a resentful tone, “GEE, BOBBY… IT;S TOO BAD WE CAN’T GIVE THIS BEAUTY A TRIAL SPIN.”. “WE’D LOSE IT IN THAT FOG FOR SURE… THAT WOULD BE NO ADVENTURE.” Says Bobby.
Windy’s face lights up and he says “NO ADVENTURE ? LOOK HERE BOBBY, I RECALL THE TIME A MODEL PLANE SAVED …” and is cut short by the store person who says “HERE COMES ANOTHER YARN!” Which suggests that Windy often tells stories. Another gentleman sitting in front of the indoor fireplace encourages Windy and says “GOOD TIME AND PLACE FOR A STORY. LET IT RIP, WINDY!”.
