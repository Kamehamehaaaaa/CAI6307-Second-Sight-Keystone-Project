S’no Use points downward on a green field and asks a red squirrel “DO YOU KNOW WHERE I AM?” It answers, “CERTAINLY! YOU’RE RIGHT OVER HERE.” A grey squirrel snickers behind it. A ribbon of narration says, “SHE INQUIRES OF A PASSING RODENT…”
“NIGHT FALLS!”, one narration box says. A loud “CRASH” emanates from out of view. S’no Use, startled, shouts “OH!” and jumps up so quickly she is followed by a cloud of dust.
Another narration box says “SHE WANDERS THROUGH THE FOREST LOOKING FOR FOOD, SHELTER, BOBBY PINS, A SHORT CUT, A TALL PRINCE CHARMING AND THE WAY OUT.” S’no Use dashes through a forest of trees which have faces that look down on her and howl, and she cries “OOH!”.
A narration box describes “SUDDENLY SHE DISCOVERS A HOUSE…” S’no Use crashes into a short house with a “BUMP!” On her rear, she says, “OH! IT’S A HOUSE!”
S’no Use stands outside while a very short, bearded man peers out of the cracked front door. He dismisses her, “SORRY - THE LADY OF THE HOUSE DOESN’T LIVE HERE.” S’no Use replies “BUT I’M NOT SELLING ANYTHING I’M S’NO USE, A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS AND I’M GOOD AND LOST!” The man asks, “JUS’ A MINUTE PLEASE.”
The man who answered the door explains to the house’s other unseen occupants, “ER- IT’S A GIRL AND - -” The unseen voices shout, “LET HER IN!”
The seven dopes introduce themselves. “WELCOME TO THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN DOPES! I’M REPULSIVE!” Repulsive begins. One in the back says, “I’M NAUSEATING” Another in the foreground says, “I’M INEDIBLE!” Another in the back says, “I’M DISGUSTING!” Another says, “I’M INCREDIBLE!” The final one says “I’M JUST A DOPE!”
