Zada continues her story, still caressing John by the chin, “AND SO I BEGAN MY SEARCH- - FROM PLANET TO PLANET - - SEEKING SOMEONE LIKE MY DEAD LOVER. MANY TIMES - - IN MANY WORLDS, I THOUGHT MY SEARCH HAD ENDED - - BUT ALWAYS.. DISAPPOINTMENT- - UNTIL I FOUND YOU!”
She wraps her arms around the back of John’s neck and head, saying “YOU ARE HIS DOUBLE! A REINCARNATION! COME BACK TO XEDES.. SHARE MY THRONE!” John refuses, “NO! I’M NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU! I LOVE JANE!”
With her lips very close to John’s, Zada continues, “NO MERE EARTHWOMAN IS A MATCH FOR QUEEN ZADA! YOU WILL COME WITH ME I COMMAND IT!”
John pushes Zada away, and they get out of bed. He demands, “GET AWAY! THIS IS JUST AN INSANE DREAM!” She replies, coyly, “A DREAM? YOU’LL FIND OUT!”
Into a red haze, Zada turns a shade of gold, disappearing from the room. As she departs, she says, “WHEN NEXT I RETURN I WILL TAKE YOU ACROSS THE VAST GALACTIC STRETCHES TO MY WORLD! FAREWELL, BELOVED!”
Over another street scene, narration says, “THE FOLLOWING MORNING, JOHN STARTED FOR WORK, HIS MIND STILL TEEMING WITH THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE, WHEN…” John notices Zada standing on the other side of the street behind two rows of traffic. He says, “THERE SHE IS - -STILL FOLLOWING ME! THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!”
In red and black monochrome, John darts across the street full of cars to confront her, without regard for the traffic he interrupts. Cars “SCREE” to a halt and their drivers shake their fists at him. He doesn’t pay attention to them, but instead realizes that Zada is not there, gasping “GONE!!”
