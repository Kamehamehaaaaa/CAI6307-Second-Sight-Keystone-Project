In profile, Beau Dillion smokes another long, thin cigar while Ham Stone stands in the background with a grin on his face and a hand on Chad’s shoulder. Beau Dillion holds his tommy gun inches from Chad’s chest and says, “OKAY, BILLOW! YOU ASKED FOR IT! NOW YOU’RE GONNA GET IT…”
Meanwhile two men armed with their own guns look over the port side of the Swift. They are unable to see the islanders climbing aboard the starboard side behind them. Narration says, “ON DECK, THE GUARDS ARE ARE UNAWARE OF KALA, AND THE POLYNESIANS AS THEY CLIMB ABOARD….”
The polynesian islanders, with Kala among them, attack the Swift’s crew with their knives and fists. In the foreground, one of the crewmen from the previous panel is struck down by a blow to his collar while islanders fight other men in the background. Beau Dillion emerges from the cabin where he was just interrogating Chad and Kala ambushes him by jumping down on him from the roof of the cabin’s stairwell. Narration explains, “WITH HARDLY AN EFFORT, KALA AND HIS FRIENDS TAKE OVER THE ’SWIFT’ THEY QUICKLY FREE CHAD, WHO IS SOMEWHAT THE WORSE FOR WEAR…”
Kala holds a glass of water under Chad’s face and says, “DRINK THIS, CHAD! YOU FEEL BETTER!” Chad rubs the side of his head. There is a bruise under his right eye and thanks him, “THANKS, KALA!” A polynesian islander unties Chad from behind.
A connected panel features a narration, “AND THE NEXT DAY, THEIR ENEMIES TRUSSED AND OUT OF THE WAY, CHAD, KALA, AND THE CHIEF GO OVER THE ‘ISLAND QUEEN’ FROM BOW TO STERN…. AND WIND UP AS PUZZLED AS BEFORE!”
