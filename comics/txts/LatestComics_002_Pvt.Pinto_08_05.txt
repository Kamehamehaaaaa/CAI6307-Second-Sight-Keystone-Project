The sergeant proudly boasts to Lulu, "WE GOT ALL THE LATEST ARMY EQUIPMENT AT THIS FIELD! STUFF THE ENEMY WOULD LOVE TO GET THEIR HANDS ON!" as they stand near a large cannon, surrounded by military gear like tanks and tents in a grassy field. Lulu, in her red dress and hat, responds with a surprised, "REALLY?" her eyes wide as she takes in the impressive setup. The sergeant, eager to impress, says, "THIS WAY, I’LL SHOW YA OUR NEWEST SOUND DETECTOR!" as he leads her toward a large, dish-like device with wheels, while planes fly overhead in the sky, setting the stage for a demonstration. Lulu replies with a sly, "THAT’S WHY I AM HERE BROTHER," hinting at her own agenda.
The sergeant explains the device, saying, "THESE ‘EARS’ CAN PICK UP SOUND O’ PLANES 100 MILES AWAY!" as he gestures to the large, funnel-shaped detectors, his face beaming with pride. Lulu, feigning alarm, reacts with, "THE EMPEROR WILL LOVE THIS SHOT!" her hands raised dramatically as she plays along. The sergeant, now wearing headphones, suddenly exclaims, "SAY—THAT SOUND! IT’S WORKING! MUST BE THOUSANDS PLANES COMING!" his expression a mix of shock and excitement as the detector amplifies a distant noise, the vibrations overwhelming him.
Panic sets in as the sergeant shouts, "IT’S AN ENEMY RAID! OUTTA MY WAY LET ME AT THAT GUN!" scrambling toward a nearby anti-aircraft cannon, his arms flailing as Lulu jumps back in surprise, her purse swinging. The sergeant, now at the cannon, looks dazed and confused, asking, "OH OH! HOW DOES THIS NEW A.A. GADGET WORK??" as he fumbles with the equipment, his hands shaking while shells lie scattered around him.
