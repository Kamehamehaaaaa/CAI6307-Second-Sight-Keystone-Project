The narrator describes that throughout the history of aircraft development models have played an ever-increasing part! Most of the features in today's aircraft were tested at the expense of Human life, with the help of controlled models, whose pilots never leave the ground and they are called WINGLESS TEST PILOTS.
A model plane is shown crashing into water. Two men are standing far from the lake near a bus. One of them seems to be holding a remote. He says “SOMETHING’S GONE WRONG! IT’S CRASHING!” 
“HURRY BEFORE IT SINKS! THE PLANE DOESN’T LOOK TOO BADLY DAMAGED!” Says the man with an orange hat and brown jacket. “SURE COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE!” Says the man in green track suits. 
Expressing relief the man in an orange hat says “YEAH! IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE REAL THING AND NOT JUST A MODEL!”
