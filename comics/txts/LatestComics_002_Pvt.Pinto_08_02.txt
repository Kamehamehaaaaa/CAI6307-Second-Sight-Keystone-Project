In a lively wartime comic, a sergeant sits dazed on the ground, surrounded by swirling stars and faint smoke, rubbing his head as he asks, "WHAT HIT ME?" still clutching a package after a chaotic mail delivery mishap, with tents and soldiers faintly visible in the background. Nearby, Pvt. Pinto, a young soldier with exaggerated ears, eagerly leans forward, asking, "ANY MAIL FOR ME, SARGE?" his eyes wide with hope. The sergeant, smirking, holds out a package and teases, "YEAH, PRIVATE, AND SAY PLEASE!" as other soldiers recover from the commotion, their figures scattered around.
Pvt. Pinto’s excitement grows as he takes the package, exclaiming, "OH BOY! A PACKAGE! WONDER WHAT IT IS?" his hands trembling with anticipation while the sergeant watches with amusement. The scene shifts as Pvt. Pinto unwraps it, his face lighting up as he joyfully shouts, "…CAKE!!" expecting a delicious treat, his mouth open in delight. The energy escalates as Pvt. Pinto rallies his fellow soldiers, calling out, "CAKE! COME AND GET IT, YOU VULTURES! YIPPEE… WE EAT!" his arms raised as other soldiers rush toward him, their figures leaping and cheering in a frenzy of excitement.
The mood shifts slightly as Pvt. Pinto, still grinning, holds up the unwrapped item and says, "WAIT A MINUTE, FELLAS… IT’S ONLY A CAKE O’ SOAP!" revealing the package contains a bar of soap instead of cake, his expression a mix of surprise and humor. A note in his hand reads, "BUT LOOK WHAT CAME WITH IT!" hinting at another surprise, leaving the soldiers’ reactions hanging in the air as they gather around, their anticipation palpable. The comic blends wartime camaraderie with playful twists, capturing the soldiers’ eager hopes and the unexpected turn of events with a lighthearted tone.
