Professor John, a man whose ginger hairline has receded to the crown of his head, looks nervously upward and kneels on one knee to address a woman who wears gold jewelry and a dress the color of red wine. He urges, “MARRY ME, AGATHA, AND THE WORLD WILL BE YOURS! WEALTH, FAME, CLOTHES…” Agatha interrupts, reclining against a cushion on a nearby couch, “NOT INTERESTED… IF THE DEAL INCLUDES YOU!” In the bushes, there is narration, “PROFESSOR JOHN KINGSLEY MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE WORLD’S MOST SPECTACULARLY SUCCESSFUL SCIENTISTS BUT WHEN IT CAME TO WOMEN THE ESTEEMED SAVANT WAS A DISMAL FLOP.”
Upset, Professor John protests, “YOU’RE LIKE THE REST OF THE WOMEN! SPENDING MY MONEY! PLAYING ME FOR A FOOL!” Agatha blows smoke from the long-filtered cigarette she is smoking and replies, “WHAT WOMAN IN HER RIGHT MIND WOULD EVER WANT TO MARRY AN UGLY REPULSIVE OLD MAN LIKE YOU!”
The background goes black, and Agatha laughs at Professor John, “THE ONLY WOMAN WHO WOULD EVER MARRY YOU WOULD BE A ROBOT… BECAUSE SHE WOULDN’T KNOW ANY BETTER! WHY DON’T YOU GO INVENT ONE?” He vows, “I WILL!”
