Sniffy, playfully bites the wife’s finger with a "WOOF!" and a "SNAP!", causing her to yell, "YEE-OWWW!" as her husband, in a blue suit, looks on in shock. 
The husband is seen pleading, "GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE, DEAR—AFTER ALL WE DO NEED A WATCH-DOG!" while the wife, in a striped dress, glares, with a chair in her hand. 
It’s bedtime now and the husband, now in a nightcap, tucking Sniffy downstairs, saying, "GOOD NIGHT, PUPPY… BE A GOOD WATCH DOG AND EAT UP ALL THE BURGLARS! REMEMBER—YOU’RE IN CHARGE DOWN HERE!" Sniffy responds enthusiastically "ARF! ARF! ARF!"
Tthe narration "LATER THAT NIGHT…", sets a suspenseful tone, showing a shadowy figure climbing inside the house through the window.
A man dressed as a burglar in a cap and scarf, sneaks in, chuckling, "WELL, WELL—A WATCH-DOG! AND HE’S GLAD TO SEE ME!! HI’YA, PUP!!" Sniffy, wagging his tail, barks "ARF!" happily.
The man is surprised as Sniffy leaps playfully around him, exclaiming, "WELL, WHADDAYA KNOW—TRICKS HE’S SHOWING ME!"
