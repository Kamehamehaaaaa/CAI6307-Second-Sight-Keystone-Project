In the first panel the doctor, reminding the importance of the serum, says to Will, “IT’S WORTH A TRY… REMEMBER THIS SERUM IS VALUABLE, WILL!”. 
Windy, the narrator of the story, describes the endeavor as “THE ARROW WITH THE TUBE TIGHTLY ATTACHED TO IT’S SHAFT, STARTS ITS SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE WIDENING RIVER…”. The archer who took the shot says with despair, “I GAVE IT ALL I HAD. I MISSED!”. “THE RAIN’S DOWN, BUT THE WIND IS AGAINST YOU. ITS NO USE!” Says the doctor stressing on the point that further endeavors of such sort might fail too.
Will starts running away from the Doctor. He’s excited and says “I’LL BE RIGHT BACK, DOC… I’VE GOT A PLAN.”
A few minutes later… Will returns with a model plane in his hand. He says “SHE’LL MAKE IT ACROSS THE RIVER FOR SURE!”. The archer mentions that Will is carrying his model plane and says “WILL ! YOUR RUBBER POWERED MODEL PLANE!”. The Doctor understands Will’s idea and says “I GET THE IDEA. LET’S TRY IT. I CAN RISK ANOTHER SERUM TUBE.”
The narrator describes that the serum tube is tied to the model plane’s body and as the model plane begins its flight, Will says “LOOK - THE WIND CAUGHT IT AND IT’S SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL!”, to which the Doctor agrees and says “SHE WON’T REACH THE OTHER SIDE. TOO BAD.”
Will turns around pointing towards a store and suggests that a gas powered plane will help and says “I KNOW MR.MILLER CARRIES GAS-POWERED MODEL PLANES. ENOUGH POWER TO RIDE THE WIND. COME ON, DOC! MR.MILLER’S HOBBY STORE IS STILL OPEN!”.
