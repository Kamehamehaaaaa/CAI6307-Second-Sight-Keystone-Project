In a bustling, wartime-inspired comic scene, a bee dressed in a blue outfit with goggles hovers above a man in a suit, who is sitting on the ground with a radio and headphones. The bee, pointing accusingly, declares, "A SPY!" as the man appears to be transmitting a message. The man, a caricatured Japanese figure wearing headphones, speaks into a microphone with a mocking, gibberish phrase, "SUKI YAKI CALLING YAKAHAMA!"—a stereotypical imitation of the Japanese language, reinforcing his role as the enemy. The bee, now alert, shouts, "DEADLY FLIES CARRYING THE DIRTY RAT! MORTAL GERMS WILL PASS HERE ON WAY TO 3:00 CITY AT 2 O'CLOCK! GOOD!" as it relays the enemy’s plan to unleash germ-carrying flies on a city, suggesting a coordinated defense is needed.
The action intensifies as the same bee, marked with urgency, zooms through a bright sky toward a beehive on a table, shouting, "BEE ALERT! I GOTTA DO SOMETHING!" with a determined expression. The scene shifts to the interior of the hive, where a royal bee in a red gown sits on a throne, surrounded by smaller bees. Another bee, pointing excitedly, informs her, "YOUR HIGHNESS! THERE'S A JAP SPY OUTSIDE WITH A SQUADRON OF MEN WE CAN CAPTURE HIM! HE IS DIRECTING GERM-CARRYING FLIES TO THE BIG CITY!" The royal bee responds, "GOODNESS! TAKE THE MEN!" as she orders action. The comic culminates with a group of bees, led by one marked "29" on its chest, bursting out of the hive in a flurry, racing through the sky with the leader shouting, "HURRY FELLOWS!"—a rallying cry to confront the looming threat. The comic blends wartime espionage with anthropomorphic humor, casting the bees as defenders against a caricatured enemy plot.
