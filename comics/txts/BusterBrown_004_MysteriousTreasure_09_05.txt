Narration says, “BACK ON THE ‘SEA HAWK’ THE NEXT DAY, THE OPERATIONS BEGIN… CHAD GOES DOWN FOR A LOOK WHILE KALA RUNS THE PUMP TOPSIDE…” A second narration box adds, “THROUGH THE INTERCOMMUNICATION PHONES CHAD TELLS KALA….” We see two large and grey fish left of Chad in a lavender, old fashioned diving suit with two portholes visible. He lifts a hatch and says, “LOWER THE TOOL KIT, AND I’LL BLOCK UP THE OPENINGS! WE’LL PUMP IN AIR AND RAISE HER LIKE A CORK!”
Topside, by the railing of the Sea Hawk, Kala lifts the diving helmet off Chad’s head and asks, “YOU THINK SHE WORK GOOD NOW?” Chad answers, “YES KALA! I’VE COVERED EVERY HOLE IN THE HULL, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE PORT TO LET THE OUT WHEN WE START THE PUMP! LET’S GO!”
A narration box annotates, “THE OLD SCHOONER LIES ON THE BOTTOM, WITH HER HULL WATERFILLED…” Below it, the silhouette of the Island Queen has a tube leading to her from the surface.
Narration continues, “THE AIR ENTERS HER HOLD, AND WATER BEGINS TO EJECT FROM THE HULL, THROUGH THE OPEN PORT…” In the foreground, the silhouette of a fish passes the Island Queen, and her bowl tilts upward toward the surface.
Finally, narration explains, “FREE OF THE BOTTOM, HER HULL FILLED WITH AIR, THE OLD SCHOONER FIGHTS THE SEA IN A GREAT ERFFORT TO FLOAT ONCE MORE!” The Island Queen has risen from the sea bed. Ocean vegetation dances in the current below seeming to reach out for her.
Kala points over the railing at the rising Island Queen. He watches her breach the surface with pillowing, foaming displacement of seawater around her and a stream of seawater pouring out from within. Several lines from her rigging hang broken from the masts and over her deck. Kala shouts, “OH BOY!! HOT DOG! WE TWO GOLBLAMED SMART FELLAS, HEY, CHAD?” Chad half-agrees “WE’RE ALL RIGHT AT THIS SALVAGE BUSINESS, KID!”
