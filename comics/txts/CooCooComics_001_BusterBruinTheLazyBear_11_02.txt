Buster Bruin lies in bed, eyes closed, with the patched yellow sheet up to his neck saying, “NOTHING LIKE A GOOD NIGHT’S SLEEP OF A FEW MONTHS.. AH-HH!”
He falls asleep snoring, “ZZZZZZ-ZZ”
Near the end-table by his bed, water drips onto the floorboards going, “DRIP!” and “SPLAT-TT!”
Then water drips onto Buster Bruin’s head from above, going “DRIP!” “DRIP!”
Buster Bruin rolls out of bed vowing, “I’LL FIX THAT DRATTED LEAK- -”
But then, Buster Bruin screams, “WOW!” and grasps his foot in his hands, face contorted in pain. Below, one floorboard near his feat curls upward out of the floor.
