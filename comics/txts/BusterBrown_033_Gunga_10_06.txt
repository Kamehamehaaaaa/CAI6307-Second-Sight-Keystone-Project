Gunga, instructs Rama, "SO, TIE TUSKER WELL, RAMA. NOW HE MUST STAY AWAY FROM US, FOR IF HE IS LOOSE, HE WILL FOLLOW," while Rama, in green, assures, "HE WILL BE TIED WELL, GUNGA." Babu exclaims, “AIE! THIS ROPE IS HEAVY!” Rama secures Tusker to a tree, the young elephant’s massive form contrasting with the mahouts’ smaller figures. The jungle’s greenery and the rope’s tautness emphasize their careful preparation.
Gunga, crouching low, observes, "NOW I DO NOT SEE PADMAH. THE ELEPHANTS STAND SO CLOSELY THAT I CANNOT RECOGNIZE HER," while Babu responds, "THAT WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. I WILL SEARCH FOR HER." The herd’s silhouettes in the distance, obscured by trees, add to the uncertainty, and Gunga’s crouched stance reflects his stealth. Rama out of concern says, "GUNGA… BE CAREFUL. I STILL FEEL WE SHOULD STOP YOU FROM GOING," as he watches Gunga move forward. 
Gunga is seen preparing, "THIS IS AS GOOD AS ANY PLACE TO START. FEED THE ROPE CAREFULLY AND BE SURE IT DOES NOT ENTANGLE ME. PERHAPS I WILL HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY," his focused gaze and the rope’s careful placement signaling his readiness. Rama reassures him, "WE WILL KEEP IT RUNNING SMOOTHLY GUNGA, BUT SHOULD AN ELEPHANT DISCOVER YOUR PRESENCE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO," followed by a blessing from Babu, "MAY THE GODS BE KIND TO YOU, GUNGA." The group’s cautious stances and the jungle’s looming presence heighten the stakes.
