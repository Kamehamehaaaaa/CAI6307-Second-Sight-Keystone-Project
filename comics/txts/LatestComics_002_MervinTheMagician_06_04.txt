We see a mustachioed monkey dressed in a green top hat and coat, gesturing animatedly with one hand while holding a handkerchief in the other. He’s speaking to a lion named Mervin, who wears a purple and orange jester hat and a blue outfit. Mervin looks surprised, with a small monkey perched on his back. The background is a simple, light sky. The monkey is saying, "SAY, I REPRESENT THE BLOWYOURKNOSE HANDKERCHIEF CO.—CAN YOU MAKE 3,000,000 DOZEN?" while Mervin responds, "DON’T BE SO SILLY—THERE AREN’T THAT MANY NOSES!"
Mervin, now center stage, sneezing dramatically with a loud "AACHOO!" His eyes are wide, and his mouth is open as he clutches his face. He’s surrounded by other small animal characters, including a mouse and a rabbit, who look concerned or amused. Mervin exclaims, "I CAN’T STOP SNEEZING! THOSE FLOWERED HANDKERCHIEFS—I’M ALLERGIC TO THEM! MY HAY FEVER!" The background shows a faint hint of flowers, adding to the comedic chaos.
The mustachioed monkey leaps into the air, throwing dollar bills everywhere as he shouts, "I’LL GIVE ALL THE MONEY I HAVE TO MAKE THOSE HANDKERCHIEFS DISAPPEAR!" The money flutters around him, and his expression is one of desperation and determination. Mervin, now calmer, stands nearby with a surprised look, saying, "ALL THAT HAY—NO WONDER YOU HAVE FEVER!"
Mervin back in control, sitting on a green box with a saw in hand. He’s grinning mischievously, wearing his jester hat and a blue bow tie. He announces, "NOW, LADIES AND GENTS, I’M GOING TO SAW MISS CATSUP INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS—COME OUT, MISS CATSUP!" The background includes a red curtain, suggesting a stage setting.
A black cat, presumably Miss Catsup, is depicted as if sawed in half, with her front and back halves separated but still smiling. She’s surrounded by a pile of fruit and vegetables, including apples and grapes, with a pig and a rabbit nearby, adding to the absurdity. Mervin mutters, "MISS CATSUP HAS BEEN SAWED IN HALF SO MANY TIMES, SHE LOOKS LIKE A PAIR OF BOOKENDS!" A hand from off-panel, possibly the audience, reaches in, asking, "MADAM, WOULD YOU PLEASE..." The scene is vibrant and chaotic, filled with exaggerated expressions and playful dialogue.
