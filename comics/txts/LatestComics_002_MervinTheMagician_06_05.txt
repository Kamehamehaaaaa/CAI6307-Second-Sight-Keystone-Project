A pig dressed in a top hat and formal attire stumbles onto the stage, gesturing with a bottle in hand. He’s slurring, "CATSUP (CHIC)! SHE’S NOT A BAD TOMATO!"

The background features a red curtain, setting the stage atmosphere.
Mervin, striding forward confidently. He declares, "MISS CATSUP WILL ENTER THE COFFIN! I WILL SAW IT INTO TWO, AND MISS CATSUP INTO A TOO-TOO TWIN!" His expression is bold and mischievous as he holds a cane, ready to begin the trick.
A wolf in a small hat hammers the coffin shut with a nail, while a hedgehog watches. Mervin stands nearby, announcing, "AS SOON AS THE COFFIN IS COMPLETELY SEALED, I SHALL PROCEED!" The scene is tense yet playful, with the coffin now sealed tight.

Mervin is actively sawing through the coffin with a large saw, grinning mischievously. He mutters, "I HOPE MISS CATSUP WON’T BE SORE WHEN I FINISH!" The background remains the red curtain, and the audience’s anticipation is palpable as the trick reaches its climax.
