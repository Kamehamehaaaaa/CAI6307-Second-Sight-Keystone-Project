The two men’s silhouettes carry Mr. Kemal away from the scene. Anna falls to her knees to attend to her husband crying, “LARS! LARS! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?” He replies, “OOO! MY-HEAD! GOT TO - GO AFTER THEM! CALL… POLICE…”
Anna grips his shoulder, baring her teeth, and pleads, “NO, LARS! IT’S MURDER… WE CAN’T GET MIXED UP IN IT, FOR THE CHILDREN’S SAKE! WHY - WE DON’T EVEN KNOW IF THAT MACHINE REALLY WORKS!” Looking shaken, Swede agrees with her, “MAYBE - YOU’RE RIGHT! CAN’T… THINK! LET’S GO HOME… THINK IT OVER…”
At a railyard elsewhere, we are greeted by a narration box, “BUT THE MACHINE IS WORKING! AS AN EARLY FREIGHT PULLS OUT OF THE YARDS AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN” From the railyard, an old steam locomotive pulls out of the station and a linesman says to the waving engineer saying, “OKAY, MAC - OPEN ‘ER UP AN’ LET’S ROLL!”
The train crashes into the invisible barrier, which is drawn as though it were made of glass, and the engine explodes into a cloud of glowing smoke while the cars behind it derail. An engineer on the ground exclaims, “GOOD GRIEF! THEY SMASHED UP!” Another man questions, “BUT - BUT HOW? THEY DIDN’T HIT NOTHIN’!” Another is shaken, “WOW! CALL THE DISPATCHER! BETTER CALL THE COPS, TOO!”
A narration box says, “ON THE STATE HIGHWAY -” Below it, a red truck is about to pass a blue streetcar on the highway when the blue car smashes into the invisible barrier from the outside. The men in the truck remark, “MIKE, LOOK! A CRACKUP! BUT- -” and “THERE WAS NOTHIN’ - THERE!”
The first man speaks again, “WHATEVER IT IS, MAKE - STOP! SLAM ON THE BR- -” Mike replies “I CAN’T WE’RE GOIN’ TOO FAS - - AAAGGHHHH!!!” The truck they are driving is a gasoline tanker. The cap of canister flies open and fumes start to waft from it.
