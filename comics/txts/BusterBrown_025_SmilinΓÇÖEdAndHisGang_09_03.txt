The scene shows the group mid-climb on a steep, snow-covered mountain. The background is a pale yellow, emphasizing the cold, snowy environment. Smilin' Ed, the stout man with a mustache, leads the group, dressed in his red and black climbing outfit with knee-high socks and a green hat with a feather. He’s holding an ice pick in his right hand and looking determined, says, "NOW—VE SCHTICK TOGEDDER UP, UNO VE CLIMB SCHLIPS UND FALLS, VE GOTTA HOLD HIM." Behind him, roped together, are the other characters: the man in a blue climbing outfit with a red hat and scarf, Midnight the Cat in a small black climbing outfit with a red bow tie, Squeaky the Mouse in his yellow and black striped shirt, and Froggy the Gremlin in his red polka-dotted outfit. The man in the blue outfit looks nervous, "GOODNESS, I WONDER IF THIS ISN’T A LITTLE TOO DANGEROUS." Froggy says, "I WISH I COULD SEE WHERE I’M GOING." The group is tightly packed, emphasizing their teamwork as they ascend the mountain.
The perspective shifts to show the group from a side angle, clinging to the steep mountain slope. The background is a reddish hue, with jagged peaks visible in the distance, adding to the sense of danger. Smilin' Ed is at the top, gripping the mountainside with his ice pick, looking back at the others. He says, "JA, DISS IS DER LIFE, HEY, SMILIN' ED?" Below him, the man in the blue outfit, now looking more anxious, responds, "MY GOODNESS, MOUNTAIN CLIMBING IS EASY, ISN’T IT, MIDNIGHT?" Midnight the Cat, clinging to the rope below, says, "NICE!" The rest of the group—Squeaky and Froggy—are also holding on tightly, their expressions a mix of determination and nervousness. A large bird, possibly an eagle, is perched on a nearby ledge, watching the group with interest.
