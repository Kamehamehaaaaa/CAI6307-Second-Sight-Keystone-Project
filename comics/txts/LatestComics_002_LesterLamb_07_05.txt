Mary, with her blonde curls and red bow, cheerfully greets a dapper banker, Mr. Havcash, calling out, "HELLO, MR. HAWCASH! HELLO MR. HAWCASH!" The well-dressed gentleman, tipping his top hat, responds warmly, "GOOD DAY, MARY! OUT FOR A STROLL, I SEE!" He launches into a long-winded spiel, saying, "MY, HOW YOU’VE GROWN, MARY! IT WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN NICE IF I HAD SEEN YOUR LITTLE LAMB BESIDE YOU… ETC., ETC., ETC.!" as his chatter fills the air.
Lester, the fluffy lamb at Mary’s side, grows increasingly impatient, muttering under his breath, "BLAH-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH. THIS OLD GEEEZER CAN TALK FOR HOURS. I GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS WINDBAG OR WE’LL BE HERE ALL DAY!" With a mischievous glint in his eye, he sneaks behind Mr. Havcash and tugs at the banker’s trousers, whispering, "THIS OUGHT TO STOP HIM IN HIS TRACKS!" Mr. Havcash, oblivious to the prank, bids farewell with, "WELL, I MUST GO NOW… GOOD DAY, MARY!" Mary, playing along with a sly grin, echoes, "GOODBYE, MR. HAWCASH, HAVE A NICE TRIP!" Lester adds with a cheeky smirk, "YEAH… HAVE A NICE TRIP, HEY!" Sure enough, Mr. Havcash trips spectacularly over a fence, tumbling to the ground in a flurry of stars, his hat flying as the scene ends with a burst of slapstick humor.
