In a lively continuation of "Mervin the Magician," the show bursts with excitement following the previous vanishing act. The first panel captures a disgruntled pig in a red and green outfit storming off the stage, her arms raised in frustration as she declares, "THAT GIRL ISN’T THE ONLY ONE WHO’LL DISAPPEAR! I’M LEAVING RIGHT NOW!" The crowd of animals—pigs, rodents, and other small creatures—claps enthusiastically, their cheers filling the air with "CLAP! CLAP!" Meanwhile, Mervin the Magician, the dapper lion in his red wizard hat with stars and a crescent moon, blue vest, and black bow tie, beams at the audience from the stage, marveling, "LOOK AT THOSE SUCKERS CLAPPING! THEY REALLY THINK I MADE HER DISAPPEAR!" Red curtains frame the scene, adding to the theatrical atmosphere.
In the second panel, a small animal in the crowd retorts, "DON’T CALL US A BUNCH OF SUCKERS! WE’RE ONLY CLAPPING TO KEEP OUR HANDS WARM!" adding a humorous twist as the audience continues to buzz with energy. Mervin, undeterred, clears his throat and addresses the crowd with a sly grin, saying, "AHEM! AS YOU CAN SEE, FOLKS, ALL I HAVE IN MY HANDS IS ONE HANDKERCHIEF! NOW WATCH…" He holds up a simple yellow cloth, teasing the audience with his next trick, his red table with a star and crescent moon decoration still visible in the background, setting the stage for more magic.
The final panel erupts with drama as Mervin shouts, "CIGAMO!" and waves his starry red cape with wild energy, lightning crackling around him to emphasize the magical flair. The trick goes awry, and he stumbles, sweating and flustered, his hat slightly askew as he pulls out not one, but multiple handkerchiefs, exclaiming, "PHEW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THREE HANDKERCHIEFS!" The handkerchiefs, tied together in a chain, dangle from his hand, a mix of colors adding to the comedic mishap. The audience roars with laughter as Mervin’s magical blunder steals the show once again, the red curtains and stage props enhancing the chaotic yet joyful atmosphere of this whimsical performance.
