The story begins in a cozy indoor setting, where Smilin' Ed and his gang—Froggy the Gremlin, Midnight the Cat, Squeaky the Mouse, and the man referred to as Mr. Traveller—are recovering from their mountain exploits. Smilin' Ed, the stout leader in his red and black outfit with a green hat, sits wearily, his body wrapped in bandages, as he confesses to Mr. Traveller, "HONESTLY, MR. TRAVELLER… I WANT TO GO HOME! I’M A SICK MAN. HAVEN’T A WHOLE BONE LEFT IN MY BODY." Mr. Traveller, dressed in a blue suit, looks concerned but encouraging, replying, "BUT, SMILIN’ ED, VE GOT TO SCHKATE, UND SKI, UND A LOT OF SCHTUFF… ODDERWISE AIN’T NO VACATION!" Nearby, Froggy, in his red polka-dotted outfit, nods enthusiastically, while Midnight and Squeaky, in their respective black and yellow outfits, peek out from behind a chair, adding a touch of curiosity to the scene.
Encouraged to give skating a try, the group heads to a frozen lake. Smilin' Ed and the man in the blue outfit, now in gray climbing gear, step onto the ice, immediately struggling with their balance. Smilin' Ed wobbles, exclaiming, "MY, MY, I FEEL A LITTLE CLUMSY!" The man in gray tries to steady him, saying, "JA, YOU FEEL THE SAME TO ME, SMILIN’ ED. TRY TO STAND UP!" Their efforts result in a comical tumble, with both sprawling on the ice, their limbs tangled. Meanwhile, Froggy, ever the optimist, skates nearby, holding a sign that reads "DANGER THIN ICE," and chirps, "SAY, I’M REALLY BACK IN SHAPE. WATCH THIS FANCY WORK!" His confident skating contrasts with the others’ clumsiness, setting the stage for trouble.
The trouble arrives quickly as Smilin' Ed, determined to join the fun, starts skating with a newfound rhythm, singing, "TRA-LA-LA-LA… TRA-LA-LA-LA-LA-??-LA-LA-LA-??-??!" His joyful glide is short-lived, however, as the ice beneath him cracks. In the next moment, Froggy and the man in gray rush to his aid, shouting, "HALP! HALP!" as Smilin' Ed plunges through the thin ice, sending up a splash of water. Froggy, clinging to the edge, calls out, "HANG ON, SMILIN’ ED—WE’RE COMING!" The man in gray and Midnight join the rescue effort, their expressions a mix of panic and determination as they try to pull Smilin' Ed back to safety.
The story concludes with a moment of relief and humor, as Mr. Traveller, watching from the sidelines, remarks, "MY GOODNESS, I HAVEN’T SKATED SINCE I WAS A BOY!" Froggy, now safely on solid ice, adds, "IT VILL ALL COME BACK TO YOU IN TWO MINUTES, SMILIN’ ED." The near-disaster turns into a lesson in rediscovering old skills, with the group’s laughter echoing across the frozen lake, turning a perilous skating attempt into another memorable chapter of their Sun Valley vacation.
