The Kangaroo Kid’s desperate cry, "MAMA-AA“ echoes through the forest, while his mother, a large kangaroo with a checkered pouch, jolts awake with a "HUH?" Her startled expression and the motion lines around her head show her sudden alertness. 
She notices her empty pouch with a "GONE!" realization, her eyes wide as she leaps into action. 
Her determination is captured as she bounds forward with a "ZIP" sound effect, her tail trailing dynamically behind her while muttering, "SOUNDS LIKE MY KID’S IN TROUBLE!" 
As the mother arrives at the scene, she exclaims, “WOT’S GOIN’ ON? GOODNESS-LIONS” while the Kangaroo Kid still surround by the lions complains, "MAMA—THESE GEN’LEMEN ARE MOLESTIN’ ME!" 
The scene erupts into action as Mom fights back, "OH THEY ARE—ARE THEY!" sending the lions flying with "OOF!" "OW-W!" "POW!" and "BIFF!" sound effects. 
The Kangaroo Kid marvels, "GEE, MOM—I DID YOU CURE THOSE LIONS OL’ LIONS!" as Mom replies, “I DID! LIONS! OOH!” Her task is complete. 
The Kid reflected, "I GUESS I SHOULDN’T HAVE LEFT YOUR POUCH, HUH?" his expression is sheepish as he stands beside Mom, to which his mom replies, “I GUESS SO...”
The Kid, now safely in her pouch, the mother snores "ZZZZ" with a content smile. While the Kangaroo kid wonders "?" As a set of locks is seen across the mothers pouch which adds a final humorous note.
