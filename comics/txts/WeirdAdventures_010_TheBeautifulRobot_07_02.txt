The professor struts down city streets beneath the stars at night, shaking his grey cane in one fist and clenching the other at his side. A narration box annotates, “LATER, AS THE PROFESSOR SCURRIES TOWARD HIS HOME LABORATORY.” He says, ”I’LL SHOW AGATHA! I’LL SHOW ALL WOMEN!”
Hunching over an unseen source of light below, Professor John continues, “I’LL CREATE A PERFECT WOMAN… MORE LOVELY THAN VENUS, MORE TEMPTING THAN HELEN OF TROY! AND SHE’LL BE MINE… ALL MINE!”
“THE PROFESSOR ENCOUNTERS HIS YOUNG ASSISTANT, JIM DRAKE.” A narration box explains. Jim hails the professor, “PROFESSOR, I’VE WONDERFUL NEWS! BARBARA AND I ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED. I WANTED YOU TO BE THE FIRST TO KNOW!” Running into the building in the light of a nearby streetlamp, Professor John scoffs at the news, “BAH! GO AWAY! DON’T BOTHER ME… I’M GOING TO BE BUSY… FOR WEEKS!”
Another narration box continues, “AND SO THE PROFESSOR IS… UNTIL… ONE UNFORGETTABLE DAY…” Leaning backward toward the viewer, showing the extend of his receding hairline, Professor John spreads his arms wide and cheers, “COMPLETED… THE GREATEST CREATION OF MY CAREER… THE BEAUTIFUL ROBOT!” Also visible, a woman in a pink dress, with a comely face and hourglass figure, stands with her head down and her eyes closed under a large glass bell.
Professor John pulls a very large electrical switch on the nearby wall, and looks over his shoulder as arcs of electricity contact the bell the robotic woman stands in. He shouts, “THE SWITCH IS FLUNG! THOUSANDS OF VOLTS ARE COURSING THROUGH HER LOVELY FORM! SOON… THE MIRACLE… WILL OCCUR!”
Professor John curves his outspread arms around the glass bell in which the woman stands. He shouts again, “IT’S HAPPENED! SHE LIVES!”
