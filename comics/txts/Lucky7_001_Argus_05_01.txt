Two men sitting in an office with Argus written on the door. One of the men wearing green suit says “ALL WE DID SO FAR WAS TO TELL A BRUNK HOW TO GET HOME —” someone is knocking at the door meanwhile the other man in brown suit replies “PATIENCE MY LAD OUR AD IN THE ’N.Y.STAR’ SURELY WILL BRING US BUSINESS — AH, A CUSTOMER —- COME IN, SIR!”.
 A young boy enters the room, the man in a brown suit asks the boy “WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU, YOUNG MAN?” The boy replies “FIND PAL. MY DOG”. The man in the green suit asks the boy “GOT ANY MONEY?” To which the boy replies that the dog is priceless.
 The man in a brown suit comforts the young boy and says “DON’T LISTEN TO HIM, SONNY. OF COURSE WE’LL HELP YOU FIND PAL.”
 “And so the trio set out to find—,” the narrator stated. “PAL ALWAYS WAITS FOR ME HERE WHEN I COME FROM SCHOLL.” Says the young boy pointing towards a house. The man in the green suit suggests asking someone from that house about Sonny’s Pal.
 “EXCUSE ME. BUT HAVE YOU SEN A LITTLE DOG AROUND?” Asks the green suit man to the guy who opens the door of the house, to which he replies “NO, I AIN’T GOT NO TIME FOR DOGS!”. From the inside of the house there’s a dog barking, “BOW WOW!” Which gets the young boy puzzled.
 The narrator states that the young boy recognized the dog, Pal’s, voice and they rushed into the house. The young boy is ecstatic after seeing Pal and runs towards him. The man in a brown suit enters the house and wonders “WHAT A HORRIBLE PLACE! I WONDER WHO LIVES IN SUCH FILTH?”.
