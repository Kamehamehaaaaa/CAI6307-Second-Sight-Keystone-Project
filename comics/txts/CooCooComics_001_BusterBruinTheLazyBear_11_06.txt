In their cot, the two cubs have been jolted awake. The grey one cries, “WAH!”; and brown one “EEYOW!”
Buster Bruin leans over them, saying “GO TO SLEEP!”
The two cubs are wide awake and ask Buster Bruin, “TELL US A STORY FIRST, PAPA!”
Reclining in a chair made of logs, with the two cubs sitting on him and wearing onesie pajamas, Buster Bruin begins, “ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE BEARS - - -”
“--- AND THE LITTLE BEAR SAID, ZZZZ-ZZZ”, Buster Bruin snores. The grey cub stands on the back of the chair and doubles over to inspect his father’s face, quizzically. The brown one smiles from Buster Bruin’s round stomach.
“PSST!” the brown cub calls to the grey one as their father snores.
