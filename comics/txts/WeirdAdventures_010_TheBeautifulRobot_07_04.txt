Professor John and Katha begin dancing in the ballroom. Two men in suits watch them and clearly speak to each other, although they are trying to be discreet. In the background another woman in a ballroom dress looks over her shoulder at Katha and scowls. Professor John explains, “ALL THE MEN ARE WATCHING YOU ADMIRATION, KATHA! AND THE WOMEN, TOO… THEY’RE JEALOUS!” Katha asks,  “JEALOUS OF ME? BUT… WHY?”
Pressing up against Katha to dance cheek-to-cheek, Professor John answers, “THEY’RE AFRAID YOU’LL STEAL THEIR MEN! HA! HA! YOU’RE THE LOVELIEST WOMAN HERE… AND YOU BELONG TO ME!” A look of pure bliss asserts itself on the face of Professor John. Meanwhile, realization dawns on Katha, and she says, “STEAL.. THEIR MEN… HOW INTERESTING!”
From behind a red curtain, Katha spies on Jim Drake and Barbara kissing passionately. She remarks, “BILL… KISSING BARBARA! BILL… IS HANDSOME. I WILL STEAL HIM… FROM BARBARA!”
In shadow, Katha tugs on Jim Drake’s collar. He shouts, “HEY?!” Barbara is shocked and confused.
Katha grips the hair on the back of Jim Drake’s head and moans, “KISS… ME…” as she kisses him deeply. Barbara is beyond offended, and throws her hands up saying, “OF ALL THE NERVE!!”
Barbara runs to Professor John to complain to him about Katha, “I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOTTEN INTO YOUR GIRL FRIEND, PROFESSOR KINGSLEY, BUT YOU’D BETTER GO OUT ON THE TERRACE! SHE’S BEEN KISSING MY BRAND NEW HUSBAND AGAINST HIS WILL - FEROCIOUSLY - FOR THE LAST TEN MINUTES!” For his own sake, Professor John is shocked, gasping “WHAT?!-” and thinking “KATHA CAN’T DO THIS TO ME!”
