The burglar surveys his loot with a sack, saying, "NOT A BAD HAUL—DID WE FORGET ANYTHING, PAL?" as Sniffy barks, "ARF!" 
The burglar marveles, "DA MAZUMA! WHAT A POOCH!!" As Sniffy uncovers a mat with money hidden below it.
The burglar, impressed, offers, "I DON’T WANTCHA TO THINK BENNY DA BOIGLAR IS UNGRATEFUL! ASK ME ANY FAVOR YA WANT, POOCH!" while Sniffy wags his tail. 
The burglar exclaims, "HE WANTS TO CARRY DA BAG… HE AIN’T HUMAN, DAT DOG!!" as Sniffy proudly grabs the sack, barking "ARF!" 
The burglar is seen handing the bag to Sniffy, saying, "OKAY, PAL… HERE’S DA BAG! SEE ME TO DA DOOR!" as the dog eagerly carries it. 
As the burglar turns around to wrap up his tools saying, “NOW I’LL JUST PICK UP ME TOOLS AN’ - -“ Sniffy is seen swinging the sack above his head. 
Sniffy, smacks the burglar with the sack, eliciting a "OOOOF! WHAM!" as he falls exclaiming “WHAT THE …!”
