A narration box explains, “IN THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOW, THE PROFESSOR CAREFULLY TRAINS HIS CREATION…” The robot woman, Professor John’s creation, reclines on a couch atop blue cushions and says, “E, F, G, H.. ER…” The scowling Professor John corrects her, “‘I’! ‘I’! THE NEXT LETTER IS ’I’! I’LL TEACH YOU HOW TO SPEAK PERFECTLY! IF IT’S MY LAST ACT ON EARTH!-?? WHAT’S THAT? From somewhere unseen to the right of the panel, Professor John hears a “KNOCK KNOCK” sound.
Professor John answers the door and rudely dismisses Jim Drake at the door, “OH, IT’S YOU, DRAKE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? GO AWAY!” Jim Drake is exasperated, “I NEVER HEAR FROM YOU ANYMORE! I’LL GO. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING’S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU!”
“MORE WEEKS PASS AND THEN…” A narration box alludes. Professor John’s robot looks slightly annoyed and faces away from him, bending her long, pale, slender legs to sit on a stool in his lab, and says “I - LOVE- YOU…” Professor John is happy, “GOOD GIRL! AND NOW, KISS ME!”
Turning back to Professor John, the robot woman asks, “KISS? WHAT IS- TO KISS??” Waving a finger high above his shoulder, Professor John explains, “KISSING IS AN OSCULATORY PROCESS PERFORMED BY THE PLACING OF ONE PAIR OF LIPS AGAINST ANOTHER. COME HERE, KATHA… I’LL SHOW YOU.”
Pressing her mouth against Professor John’s without posturing her lips into the correct formation for a kiss, Katha asks him, “WHY DO PEOPLE KISS? I THINK GETTING MY BATTERY CHARGED IS MUCH NICER.” Professor John laments, “BLAST IT! THIS INFERNAL CONTRAPTION HAS THE PASSION OF A DEEP FREEZE UNIT!”
A narration box hangs over a wedding reception scene, saying “IT OCCURRED TO THE PROFESSOR THAT HAVING THE BEAUTIFUL ROBOT MEET MORE HUMANITY MIGHT BE HELPFUL, AND SO…”
Professor John introduces Katha to Jim Drake and his bride, “KATHA… MEET JIM AND BARBARA!” Jim regards them, “WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE! YOU’VE BEEN SUCH A RECLUSE, PROFESSOR, I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW UP AT MY WEDDING RECEPTION!”
