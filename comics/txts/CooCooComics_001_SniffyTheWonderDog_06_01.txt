A stout shopkeeper in a green suit is seen standing. Inside the shop “Pooch Palace”, whose face is filled with frustration, scolds Sniffy, a scruffy yellow dog with floppy ears, saying, "COME ON, LOOK APPEALING! I CAN’T KEEP YOU FOREVER!!”, while a passerby in orange pants, a black shirt and hat notices the shopkeeper in the act.
The shopkeeper urges Sniffy, "YOU’RE EATING ME OUTTA HOUSE AND HOME! GETTA GOOD DOG AND BE NICE TO THE CUSTOMERS… MEGBBE THEY’LL ADOPT YOU!!" Sniffy responds with a cheerful "ARF!" as he sits on a counter, a "Cheap" sign dangling nearby. 
The shopkeeper, exasperated, adds, "I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE RUNNING A CUT-RATE DOG STORE! ONE MORE WEEK AND YOU’LL BE SUB-LET TO THE FIVE AND TEN!" pointing dramatically upwards in the air. 
A customer in a blue coat enters, prompting the shopkeeper to exclaim, "AHH! A CUSTOMER! NOW REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD - -LOOK SAD - - - YOU’RE AN ORPHAN" while gesturing toward Sniffy, who now wears a "For Sale" sign, as it starts raining outside. 
The shopkeeper coaches Sniffy, "THAT’S THE STUFF! YOU’LL HAVE HIM HOOKED IN A MINUTE!!" while Sniffy and the customer both cry "BAW!" in unison, their expressions are a mix of desperation and humor.
