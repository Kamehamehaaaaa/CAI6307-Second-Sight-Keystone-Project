The story picks up on the frozen lake where Smilin' Ed, the stout leader in his red and black climbing outfit with a green hat, is struggling after falling through thin ice. He’s clinging to the edge, his face contorted in panic as icy water splashes around him. Froggy the Gremlin, in his red polka-dotted outfit, and Midnight the Cat, with her red bow tie, are using a wooden plank to reach him, shouting, "HANG ON, SMILIN’ ED, VE’LL RESCUE YOU!" Squeaky the Mouse, in his yellow and black striped shirt, and the man in gray climbing gear join in, yelling, "YEAH, WE’RE COMIN’, SMILIN’ ED!" Midnight, however, shivers as she helps, muttering, "NICE! MIDNIGHT! COLD WATER IS NOT NICE!" Their teamwork pays off as they pull Smilin' Ed out, his expression shifting to one of relief as they hoist him onto the ice with an "UPSY DAISY!" from Froggy, while Squeaky adds, "WE GOT YOU, SMILIN’ ED!"
Once safely on solid ground, the group gathers around Smilin' Ed, who looks like a frozen block of ice, his body stiff and covered in frost, resembling a glacier. Froggy, ever the optimist, grins and says, "SMILIN’ ED LOOKS LIKE A GLACIER, HE DOES!" The man in gray, now known as Mr. Traveller, suggests, "MY GOODNESS, MR. TRAVELLER, VE GOT TO MELT HIM!" Squeaky, always thinking ahead, chimes in with, "FOR-GRACIOUS-NESS SAKES LET ME THINK!" They quickly build a fire, and the group huddles around it, warming Smilin' Ed as the ice begins to melt. Smilin' Ed, still shivering, mutters, "JA! DOT’S VAT HE NEEDED, A LEEDLE VARMNESS!"
As Smilin' Ed thaws, the conversation turns to the next activity. Froggy, holding a pair of skis, declares, "ICE-CUBE MCCONNELL THEY CALLED HIM IN THE OLD DAYS." Smilin' Ed, now feeling better, stands up with a determined grin, saying, "SMILIN’ ED, THE LAST GOOD TIME VE VILL HAVE AT ZUN VALLEY IS ON SKIS. NOW YOU VILL SHOW A SLALOM!" The man in gray, however, looks exhausted, replying, "I’D RATHER YOU’D SHOW ME A BED, I’M A GOOD SKIER, I AM, I AM!" The group, including Midnight and Squeaky, prepares for the final leg of their vacation, their laughter and camaraderie warming the chilly air as they gear up for a new adventure on the slopes.
